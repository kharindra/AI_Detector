1,"If your child went on a hunger strike because they only wanted to eat fast food/highly processed foods, how would you handle that scenario?",Call their bluff until it was clear they need professional help.,"I would handle this situation by first explaining to my child why a hunger strike is not a healthy way to try to get what they want. I would then try to find a compromise that works for both of us. I would talk to my child about the importance of eating a balanced diet and offer healthier alternatives that incorporate some of their favorite flavors and ingredients.

When she hit me up with how much it was gonna cost me for excess weight fees, I replied in Italian.

I always thought the girls who focused on that sort of thing, in high school, were wasting their time. But I'm the one with the messy ponytail still trying to figure out mascara every time there's a date/formal event.","Yes, I definitely feel like I missed out on that course. I think the best way to deal is to just research and experiment on your own. There are a lot of great tutorials out there, and you can also ask your friends or family members who know more about it.

I'd rather go back almost, but camping is indeed scary lol","Yes, I have felt that way before.

24,"Why do you think cellphones rarely make appearances in our dreams, despite our extensive daily use of them?","My theory is that, because the screen is constantly changing, our subconscious doesn't really see the phone as a single object, but as a series of objects that constantly change.","Cellphones are such a part of our daily lives that they don‚Äôt stand out in our dreams. They don‚Äôt have the same emotional significance or power that other objects in our dreams can have, so they don‚Äôt often appear in our dreams. Additionally, our dreams are often a reflection of our subconscious thoughts, and since our cellphones are such a regular part of our lives, we may not give them much thought and thus they don‚Äôt appear in our dreams."
25,[Serious] Why aren't more people complaining to the US government about wages and such not keeping up with rent and house prices?,"1. They do.
2. Federal Government don't and shouldn't set wages (beyond MW) or rent.","There are several factors that contribute to why people may not be complaining to the US government about wages and such not keeping up with rent and house prices. 

First, many people may simply not be aware that their wages are not keeping up with rent and house prices. In addition, people may not realize that they have the power to make their voices heard in the political process. They may not be aware of the channels available to them to voice their concerns or the impact their participation can have on the policy-making process. 

Second, people may not be willing to take the time and energy to engage in the political process. It can be difficult and time-consuming to attend protests, write to elected officials, or even just fill out a survey. People‚Äôs lives are already busy and it can be hard to make the time to participate in politics. 

Finally, some people may not feel that their voice will make a difference. They may feel that their opinion doesn‚Äôt matter or that the government will not listen to them. This can be especially true for people in lower-income brackets who may feel that their opinion is not valued or taken seriously. 

These are just a few of the potential reasons why people may not be complaining to the US government about wages and such not keeping up with rent and house prices. It is important for people to know that their voices and opinions can make a difference and that they have the power to make their voices heard in the political process."

62,What was the last thing that made you smile genuinely?,Dentist.,My daughter's laugh.
63,"What is your ancestry, and does it influence you?","I'm a dual citizen, Swiss and Greek (I grew up in Switzerland).

Dad's side: grandma comes from Greece, grandpa comes from Switzerland. They met when my grandpa traveled to Greece as a young lad. My dad was born and grew up there but later they moved (back) to Switzerland.

Mom's side: Both grandparents were born in Switzerland. My grandpa's parents were Germans though who immigrated to Switzerland shortly before WWI broke out. My grandma also had a German ancestor, a grandfather who immigrated to Switzerland in the 1870s. He was an ivory carver by trade (yes, that was a job back then). In Interlaken he opened a shop where he sold beautiful figurines and little statues which he had carved out of ivory. The shop was very successful, so he expanded it to sell other goods from far-away places such as exotic spices, fruits, rice etc.. In German this was called a ""Kolonialwarenladen""; literally a shop which sold various goods from European colonies in Africa, Southeast Asia etc..

I think the biggest affect my ancestry has on me are the vastly different socio-economic levels my parents' families come from. My mom's family was fairly affluent. Not rich but differently well-off. My maternal grandparents could afford a lot of things that other people in the 1950s/1960s couldn't, such as going on vacation every year, buying a vacation home abroad, buying their own motoryacht (it was small but still) etc.. My dad's family comes from extremely, unfathomably poor backgrounds. My paternal grandma grew up during WWII in Greece (Nazi occupation) and right after that was over, Greece was thrown into a bloody, horrific civil war. My grandpa, even though he comes from Switzerland, also grew up in an extremely poor family. His parents both died at a young age because they constantly ate moldy food (they couldn't afford to buy fresh food). His father was also an abusive alcoholic.

I think these vastly different, socio-economic backgrounds have made me hyper-aware of issues pertaining to inequality, poverty etc. (hence my username). From looking at my own family background, I can see how wrong people are who claim that wealth/poverty has something to do with how hard you work or how smart you are. This is nothing but Protestant propaganda. In reality, 95% of it comes down to pure luck. My paternal grandma is a very smart woman. She was simply unlucky to be born in war-torn Greece. She ended up doing manual labor her entire life but maybe if she had grown up in an affluent family in Switzerland, she would've attended university and may have had a very prosperous career. Likewise, my German ancestor who worked as an ivory carver was simply lucky that ivory was so popular during the Belle Epoque (1860-1914). In essence, he was a craftsman like carpenters or goldsmiths etc.. Nothing bad but also nothing outstanding. He became a very successful businessman and I'm sure that was partially due to his intelligence and his great talent but he was also simply lucky.","My ancestry is mostly German, with some Irish and Scottish mixed in. It does influence me in a few ways. I'm very proud of my German heritage, and I identify with it strongly. I also have a strong sense of loyalty and responsibility, which I believe are common traits in German culture."

76,What is a statistic that tells one story on its face value but after examination tells a completely different one?,"Coca-Cola was losing market share to Pepsi steadily, and wanted to find a way to destroy their competitor. So in 1985, they released New Coke, a reformulation of their soft drink. They were going off of two statistics (spoiler alert: both will have plot twists).

The first statistic was that in blind-taste tests, participants preferred Pepsi to Coke. So Coca-Cola thought they needed to switch things up.

The second statistic was that after Coca-Cola came up with the new formula, in tests, participants preferred New Coke's taste over Pepsi.

So, New Coke should have been a smashing success, right? It should have taken over the market by storm and scored a huge victory for Coca-Cola over Pepsi, right?

Quite the contrary, New Coke was a massive failure.

Both statistics, as it turns out, tell a different story upon examination. The first is probably quite well-known. Pepsi is preferable when participants are asked about the tastes very quickly after tasting. It's sweeter, so at first, people like it better than Coke. But Coke is preferred if you wait a bit longer.

As for the second, take a guess why people weren't a fan.

Turns out, the wrong question was asked. Instead of asking if people liked New Coke better than Pepsi, they should have asked if people liked New Coke better than the original Coke.","On its face value, a statistic showing that the average income of people in a certain area is $100,000 may seem to suggest that the people in the area are well-off.

The US Air Force used to be the Army Air Force, until just after WWII when we realized that air power was now its own major part of warfare, and we should probably have a dedicated branch for it. 

This time, we're getting ahead of it, realizing that space would probably be a major battleground in a modern conflict with anybody with space capabilities, and establishing a branch for it. 

Because the fact is, if we're going up against somebody else with orbital assets, not only will there likely be some form of warfare going on up there, but the stakes for humanity's future in space travel are very high. There's already a lot of garbage in the way without tons of spy satellite debris added to the mix.","The United States Military created a new branch of military solely dedicated to fighting space wars in order to protect U.S. interests in space, ensure access to space-based capabilities, and protect U.S. satellites and spacecraft from potential adversaries.

238,How does one handle an overly-promiscuous narcissist mother?,"Just for some background and clarity: My mother did not raise me, my grandparents did while she partied with friends and put no effort into actually having myself and my brother in her life. But to hear her tell it, she was forced into giving us up. I remember quite clearly her *choosing* to leave us everytime she did. 

Years ago when I was 15, she begged me to come live with her. Told me all these fun things would happen, I would have my own room and we would build a relationship. Well I was a fucking fool because all I ended up being used for was a babysitter to her then boyfriends kids while she lived her life...as usual. I was subjected to emotional abuse, threats of physical violence and having to build up her ego every. single. day. 

Fast forward through her fucking me over numerous times in ways that no loving parent could fathom. I'm 28, I don't need a mother's comfort. I never had it so I accepted that I never will. It's all good.

But I'm going through a crisis in life, due to separating from my kid's father so her and I have moved back in together. Things are mostly *okay* but the older she gets the more pathetic she gets and I don't know how to just pretend like it isn't happening. Firstly, she's a severe alcoholic who claims she drinks because she *wants* to and that it's nobody's business even though her demeanor changes and she'll just pass out wherever she's at, no matter who's around or what she has planned. Secondly, she brags so bad about how her shit is together and she pays her bills but she has *always* begged other people for money and she even acts like she is going to claim one of my kids because her stupid ass refuses to have federal taxes taken from her checks. She claims she can't afford to pay taxes. Well bitch, if you can't pay taxes then you can't afford to buy that $100 worth of beer a week can you? And third but not last, she's fucking boy crazy. On the phone with men all day, everyday. Even guys she doesn't know she will talk about them as if she has known them her whole life. She legitimately has no type because basically anybody who gives her attention will get attention from her. She's messed with guys younger than me. She messes with married men, men in jail and acts as if it's a flex because they'd rather talk to her than their own wives. I told her they are losers, nothing more. She'd rather argue with this one guy who is the same age as me than just stop fucking with him. It's so stupid and anytime I bring logical to her attention she immediately goes on the defensive.""What's wrong with me doing...blah blah blah"" and I'm like 'nothing's *wrong* per say but what exactly are you getting out of it?' To which she either can't or is unwilling to dig deep enough to answer that. 

But here lately she's been driving me crazy. She had one of her coworkers over and he was flirting with *ME*, barely even talking to her. Once he left she acted as if he was flirting with *HER*. She was sitting there drinking the whole time him and I were talking so I don't see how she came to the conclusion that things went a certain way. 

Anyway, we live in a nice neighborhood directly across the street from my daughter's elementary school. There's a 30 year old guy next door who stays with his mother. She thinks he's cute, she only knows his name, but acts as if they actually know each other. She makes a point to walk outside half dressed as much as she can to try and get his attention. It's clear that he's uninterested in her old hoe ass but she tries harder and harder everyday. Yesterday she literally changed her shorts before walking her dog, so that half her asscheeks were hanging out. It's so classless and disgusting. Just be the 50 year old grandmother that you are. You've spent my entire life being this way and it has literally got you nowhere.

I don't think these things would bother me so much if she didn't always walk around thinking everybody wanted her, or patting herself on the back for the tiniest accomplishments. She doesn't even give other people the credit and appreciation they deserve for making *her* life easier. She wants to tell people how they should look, but says that no one is going to tell her anything. It oozes low self esteem, the need for validation and just not having any real personality.

I cannot find a single admirable quality about this bitch other than her being here for me in this one period in my life. But even now, I hear her on the phone over exaggerating her part to get praise from others. 

How in the fuck do I cope with this, without wanting to explode on her ass?","It can be difficult to handle an overly-promiscuous narcissist mother. It is important to remember that you are not responsible for your mother's behavior. It is important to set boundaries and limits that you are comfortable with, and to communicate these to your mother in a clear and direct manner.

Talking maybe sound like its worthless sometimes, but if you‚Äôre ever struggling, having someone to simply talk to can make all the difference. You need to get the shit out of your head and vocalize it, for your own benefit. 
A good friend is invaluable‚Ä¶ but if you dont, and most of us don‚Äôt. I‚Äôd recommend getting in touch with a community support group, a phone line thing, or chat to your Dr. (Im aussie and Dr‚Äôs are cheap here) 
Find somewhere that lets you call and chat to someone when you need, or meet up, and just talk bro. 
I kept shit in for 20 years and that stuff fucks you up after a while.. 

Good luck and you‚Äôre never alone regardless of how far away you may feel sometimes. 
Peace n Love","My advice would be to focus on the present and take things one day at a time. It's important to remember that it's normal to struggle at times, and that's ok. Find healthy and productive ways to cope with your struggles, such as talking to a trusted friend or family member, seeking professional help, practicing mindfulness, or engaging in physical activity. Don't be afraid to reach out for help and remember that you are not alone."
