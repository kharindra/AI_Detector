81,You think you are having a chill day and suddenly-,I cannot make heads or tails of what is happening here,"Suddenly, something unexpected happens and throws your day off balance. You could be surprised by a phone call or a visitor, a power outage, or a natural disaster. Whatever the unexpected event is, it can be stressful and confusing. The best way to handle it is to take a deep breath, stay calm, and assess the situation. If the event is something that you can control, take the necessary steps to resolve it.

84,Capturing a volcanic eruption just as the volcano is mentioned,"I like how ""wow"" is apparently a universal saying","Capturing a volcanic eruption as it is occurring requires special equipment and planning. If you are in the vicinity of an active volcano, it is important to follow safety guidelines and to stay at least 10 kilometers away from the eruption. It is also important to ensure that you have proper protective equipment, such as a gas mask, and that you are prepared for the possibility of ash and other debris falling from the sky.

Once you are in a safe position, you can begin to capture the eruption. Depending on the size of the eruption, you may be able to take photographs with a digital camera, or you may need to use a video camera for more detailed footage. If possible, use a tripod to keep the camera steady and capture the best possible images.

If you are able to get close enough, you can also use a drone to capture footage of the eruption from a safe distance. This method is especially useful for capturing the speed and intensity of the eruption, and can provide unique perspectives of the eruption that would not be possible otherwise.

No matter what method you use, capturing a volcanic eruption is an amazing experience. Be sure to stay safe and follow all safety guidelines, and you can capture amazing images that you will remember forever."

120,Bloke wins gold medal in speed skating after avoiding pile up on the last lap,"During a 1994 World Cup event in Montreal, another skater's blade sliced through Bradbury's right thigh after a collision; it cut through to the other side and he lost a great deal of blood.[9] Bradbury's heart rate had been up near 200 at the end of the race and this meant that blood was being pumped out fast. All four of his quadriceps muscles had been sliced through, and Bradbury thought that he would die if he lost consciousness. He needed 111 stitches and could not move for three weeks. His leg needed 18 months before it was back to full strength.[10]

In September 2000, Bradbury broke his neck in a training accident. Another skater fell in front of him and Bradbury tried to jump over him, but instead clipped him and tripped head first into the barriers. As a result, Bradbury fractured his C4 and C5 vertebrae. He spent a month and a half in a halo brace, and needed four pins to be inserted in his skull and screws and plates bolted into his back and chest.[13] Doctors told Bradbury that he would not be able to take to the ice again, but he was determined to reach another Olympics.

After consulting his national coach Ann Zhang, Bradbury's strategy from the semi-final onwards was to cruise behind his opponents and hope that they crashed, as he could not match their pace.[15] His reasoning was that risk-taking by the favourites could cause a collision due to a racing incident, and if two or more skaters fell, the remaining three would all get medals, and that as he was slower than his opponents, trying to challenge them directly would only increase his own chances of falling.[15][16] Bradbury said that he was satisfied with his result, and felt that as the second-oldest competitor in the field, he was not able to match his opponents in four races on the same night.[17]

In his semi-final race, Bradbury was in last place, well off the pace of the medal favourites. However, defending champion Kim Dong-sung of South Korea, multiple Olympic medallist Li Jiajun of China and Mathieu Turcotte of Canada all crashed, paving the way for Bradbury to take first place and advancing him through to the final.

In the final, Bradbury was again well off the pace when all four of his competitors (Ohno, Ahn Hyun-Soo, Li and Turcotte) crashed out at the final corner while jostling for the gold medal. This allowed Bradbury, who was around 15 m behind with only 50 m to go, to avoid the pile-up and take the victory.[15][16][18] Bradbury became the first person from a southern hemisphere country to win a Winter Olympic event.","The crowd erupted as David Smith crossed the finish line, taking the gold medal in the men's speed skating final. Smith had managed to avoid a pile up on the final lap, which caused several other skaters to go down, and he was able to maintain his speed and take the lead. After the race, Smith was elated with his victory, and thanked his coaches and family for all their support. He said that the win was a dream come true, and that he was grateful to have been able to achieve it."
121,Perfectly timed sprinkler,“Observe”,"A perfectly timed sprinkler system would be one that is programmable and can be adjusted to water the lawn at certain times of the day.

124,"Tree stopped by fence inches from the roof of the car, it was unscathed and parked in same spot next day","""Huh I don't remember parking in the shade, neat""",It is likely that the tree stopped by the fence due to the friction of the fence against the tree trunk. The friction and the force of the tree's momentum were likely enough to stop the tree from reaching the roof of the car. The car was likely unscathed because the force of the tree's momentum was not enough to cause any damage. The car was also likely parked in the same spot the next day because the tree had been stopped by the fence and did not cause any damage.
125,Off-street parking available.,Car henge in the making,"Off-street parking is available at many businesses, apartment complexes, and other locations. Depending on the location, there may be a fee for parking, or it may be free. Some locations may also offer designated parking spaces for those with a disability."

Additionally, playing sports can teach kids important values such as teamwork, respect, and dedication."
128,The perfect moment doesn't exi..,"Bumps back of head, both look left and right 😂","No, the perfect moment does exist, although it may vary for different people. For some, it may be a time of peace and relaxation, while for others it could be a moment of joy and celebration. Ultimately, the perfect moment is a unique experience that each person defines for themselves."
129,So is that a front-end or rear-end collision?,He was just trying to get a better view of the accident...,"It depends on what type of collision it is.

136,knocked a circle out of a glass,That happens pretty frequently with cylindrical glasses.,"plate

This is possible, but it should be done with extreme caution. You should wear safety glasses and use a drill bit with a diamond tip to drill a hole in the glass plate. Start by drilling a small hole at the center of the circle you wish to make. Then, slowly increase the size of the hole, being careful not to cause the glass to shatter. When you are finished, use a glass cutter to cut along the inside of the circle to separate it from the plate."
137,The phone going from one pocket to another,Am I the only one that was hoping the phone would jump over to the other girl's pocket?,This is not possible. Phones cannot move from one pocket to another on their own.
138,Jack-o-lantern on a snakes back,This is a ball python and they take many years of selective breeding to get results like this. Certain unique morphs can be worth thousands of dollars.,"This is a difficult question to answer as there is no definitive answer. While it could be argued that it is possible for a snake to carry a jack-o-lantern on its back, it is not likely due to the fact that it would be too heavy and could cause discomfort or harm to the snake. It is also possible that the presence of the jack-o-lantern could startle or scare the snake, and this too could cause harm. Therefore, it is not recommended to put a jack-o-lantern on a snake's back."
139,Was working on a squeak in the front bearing when I notice this.,This should be the sticky pic for this sub.,"If you notice a squeak in the front bearing, it's important to determine what is causing the noise. It could be due to a lack of lubrication, a misaligned bearing, or a worn part. If the bearing is misaligned, you'll need to adjust it. If there is a lack of lubrication, you'll need to properly lubricate the bearing. If the part is worn, you'll need to replace it. In any case, you should take the time to properly diagnose and repair the issue so that you can ensure the safety and reliability of your vehicle."

The best locations for kitesurfing in South Africa are Cape Town, Langebaan, Durban, and Port Elizabeth."

Customers must visit the restaurant in person to place an order.
145,Surviving by slimmest of margins at 138mph (222km/h),"driving 222km/h and that at night, what could go wrong?","Surviving at this speed is almost impossible, as the human body is simply not designed to withstand the tremendous forces experienced at such a speed. The amount of force acting on the body at this speed is equivalent to the force of gravity, which means that the body would be subject to tremendous G-forces. The body would likely be torn apart by the immense force, and even if it were to survive, the person would likely suffer severe injuries and trauma."
146,Lasso’d a fish instead of catching it the normal way (zoom in on tail),"When I was a kid, I knew an old man who could consistently catch bluegill like that. The water was clear so he could see the fish approach his bait and he had a way of flicking the pole to snag the tail fins. My little cousins and I were always thoroughly entertained.","Using a lasso to catch a fish is not the most efficient or effective way to do so. The best way to catch a fish is by using a rod and reel, or a net. Lassoing a fish can be dangerous to both the fish and the person attempting to catch it. The tail of the fish can be easily damaged by the rope of the lasso, so it is best to avoid this method."
147,A woman named Elvita Adams tried to commit suicide in 1979 by jumping off the Empire State Building. She jumped from the 86th floor but was blown back onto the 85th by a strong gust of wind.

Soaring with no care.

It had a new place to find."

216,Captured shark helps solve murder,That must've cause panic if it was during opening hours,"case

In 2017, a captured shark in the waters off the coast of Australia helped solve a murder case. 

The murder victim was a man named Peter Clarkson, who went missing after going out on a fishing trip in August of 2016. His body was never found, but his boat was discovered with the engine running and its navigation system still active. 

After months of investigation, police were unable to find any clues as to what happened to Peter. That is, until they captured a large tiger shark in the waters off the coast of Australia. 

When the shark was brought into the laboratory, the scientists examining it found a human tooth embedded in one of its teeth. DNA testing confirmed that the tooth belonged to Peter Clarkson. 

This evidence was enough to convict the suspect in Peter's murder. The suspect had been fishing in the same area at the same time as Peter, and the shark's tooth provided the proof that the suspect had indeed killed Peter. 

The case highlights the importance of marine life in solving criminal cases. While it is rare for a shark to be involved in a murder case, their presence can provide valuable evidence to help solve the crime."
