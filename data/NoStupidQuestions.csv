0,Are there really people who just DO NOT eat vegetables?? Why?,"My guy friend hates vegetables. Will not eat them in any form. Even the thought of eating them, to him, makes him sick. Fruit is very hit or miss. We’ve deduced he only likes the fruit that is the “worst” for you. (The fruit that’s basically candy). My boyfriend and I ordered a pizza with green peppers on it, expecting that he could just take them off, and he acting extremely offended that we dare assume that, and lost his appetite from looking at it. 

His home life as a child contributed to this. Without making this long af, his dad essentially was a “yes, man” and never made him eat vegetables (or a lot of other things) and has mentally stunted him as well. We’re slowly helping him. He had no idea food had nutritional labels. He never cared to look at packages and no one taught him. He didn’t know that eggs were good for you. He thought they were junk food like donuts. Which he thought junk food was just “fake factory food” and not “real food” (think pastes of plastic and chemicals turned into food) and not just high calorie, because he also didn’t know what a calorie was. 

He’s a very odd dude. He’s 26. How he has made it this far in life, I don’t know. I started a notepad list of “Shit (his name) Says” of all the crazy things he has said. “Why do we have to use soap in the shower?” “Why is being an alien illegal? Shouldn’t we try to befriend aliens for their technology?”","Yes, there are people who do not eat vegetables. Some people have dietary restrictions or allergies that prevent them from eating certain types of vegetables. Others may simply not like the taste or texture of vegetables. Some people may also have a cultural background that does not include vegetables as part of the traditional diet."
1,Is it ok to make a take away lunch at a hotel breakfast buffet?,"At every buffet I've been to, it's against the rules.

That being said, family tradition was to go with cargo pants and pockets lined with Ziploc bags. So yes, it's wrong but people do it.","Yes, it is usually permitted to make a take away lunch at a hotel breakfast buffet. However, you should always check with the hotel staff prior to doing so to ensure that it is allowed."
2,What do I have to do to become a desirable woman?,Maybe you're looking for the type of man who chooses women solely based on looks.,"Becoming a desirable woman involves many different things. It includes taking care of your physical appearance, such as dressing well, taking care of your skin, hair and nails, and exercising regularly. Additionally, being confident and having a positive attitude can make you more attractive to others. Finally, cultivating good relationships with friends, family, and colleagues can help you become more desirable."
3,Is it embarrassing to order one meal for two people in a restaurant?,Nothing is embarrassing if you don't care.,"No, it is not embarrassing to order one meal for two people in a restaurant. In fact, many people do this to save money or to share a meal."
4,Are dating apps actually useless?,"I’ve been dating my girlfriend for 3 years and we met on bumble. We would have never met otherwise because we lived in different parts of our city and never really went to the same spots. 

I will admit though that it took 2 years and plenty of first dates that went nowhere as well as a few very weird people. Like the girl who told me I was a pussy for being too nice while messaging her","No, dating apps are not useless. In fact, they can be a great resource for people who are looking to meet new people or find potential romantic partners. However, it is important to remember that dating apps are not a substitute for real-life connections and relationships. They can be a helpful tool, but should not be relied on exclusively."
5,"If Germany calls itself Deutschland, why don't we call it that? Same for all other countries, why not pronounce their native names?","It’s called “*exonyms*”.

Germany is a tricky one, because it was the name that the Roman Empire gave to that area. But the very people didn’t call themselves that.

However, remote places kept the reference to the Roman name. And adding that until 250 years ago the fastest way you could travel was on a horse, people stuck with a lot of exonyms, letting them be cemented into language long before we had more direct communication.","It is not necessary to pronounce the native names of countries in order to refer to them. English speakers often prefer to use the English names for countries since this is a more familiar and recognizable way to refer to them. Additionally, many countries have multiple names in multiple languages, which makes it difficult to choose a single name that everyone can agree on."
6,How do I avoid cartels when I go to South America?,Stay in the cities and keep your nose out of their business.,"1. Avoid buying goods from vendors on the street, as they may be part of a cartel.

10. Stay in touch with your local embassy or consulate, as they can provide information about the latest security situation in the region."
7,How bad is smoking weed underage?,"There are multiple studies that show smoking weed before your brain is done developing affects your development, specifically damaging your short term memory. Your brain isn't done until your early to mid 20s","Smoking weed underage is generally considered to be a bad idea because it can have a negative impact on your health, as well as cause legal problems. In many places, it is illegal to possess or use marijuana if you are under the age of 21. Additionally, smoking weed at a young age can have an effect on your brain development, as well as pose a risk of addiction. It is important to be aware of the risks and to make safe and responsible decisions."
8,"What do you call the effect when a company proposes an outrageous change to their product, then partially steps it back and people accept it because it's ""not as bad"", which was their plan all along?","This strategy is often referred to as the ""Door-in-the-Face"" technique. The principle behind this technique is that after someone refuses a large request (the metaphorical ""door in the face""), they are more likely to agree to a smaller, more reasonable request. By initially proposing the outrageous change, the subsequent less radical change seems more palatable in comparison.","This is known as the ""slippery slope"" effect. It is a form of manipulation that relies on people's tendency to accept small changes more readily than larger ones."
9,"Why do people say ""Quote Un-Quote"" and THEN say the thing that is the quote?",I prefer just using air quotes along with eyebrow lifts simultaneously.,"The phrase ""quote unquote"" is used to indicate that the speaker is quoting someone else's words or ideas. It is used to indicate that the speaker is not necessarily endorsing the words or ideas they are quoting, but is simply reporting them. The phrase emphasizes the fact that the speaker is quoting someone else and not expressing their own opinion."
10,Is it normal to shampoo ur hair everyday?,"If you are happy with the results, you have a good routine. If you're not satisfied, try changing something. Many commenters here have strong opinions but everyone's got different hair and a different scalp. Don't get too discouraged if something doesn't work the first week though, many of these changes that are suggested require more like a month of settling in to really see what the effects are. I have some friends who shampoo every day and some who don't. I personally don't, but I think both choices are popular enough to be described as normal.","No, it is not recommended to shampoo your hair every day. Shampooing your hair too often can strip it of its natural oils and lead to dryness and frizz. It is best to shampoo your hair two to three times a week."
11,Why is sex considered extremely taboo content in video games and other media compared to violence and crime?,"It does seem strange that it seems like nudity and sex are treated as more mature content than literally murdering innocent people for fun

Guess that shows we humans love and value of entertaining violence, but sex/actual love/intimate relationships are just too real/emotionally impactful","Sex is considered more taboo than violence and crime in video games and other media because it is seen as more personal and intimate. It is often seen as a private matter, and as such, it can be seen as inappropriate or even offensive to portray it in a public medium. In addition, sex is often associated with certain moral and ethical values, which may be at odds with the values of certain audiences. Furthermore, sex can be seen as a form of exploitation or objectification, which can also be seen as inappropriate or offensive."
12,Can someone explain why anyone would want to live in (like downtown) a big city?,"I live in Tokyo. 

The rent here isn't that bad, I bought my apartment about ten years ago.

The noise can be annoying. Especially as I grew up in the countryside. But the convenience is incredible. I can easily walk to many supermarkets, department stores, shops, gyms, parks, bars, restaurants etc. I don't need to own a car which saves a ton of money. There are always job opportunities.

It's worth the trade off, at least for now.","Living in a big city offers a range of opportunities and experiences that many people can’t find anywhere else. Big cities often have a bustling nightlife, numerous cultural attractions, and a wide variety of restaurants, stores, and entertainment venues that can’t be found in smaller towns. Additionally, people who live in big cities often have access to better job opportunities, better public transportation, and more diverse social circles. Big cities also tend to have more affordable housing options than smaller towns, making it easier for people to find a place to live that fits their budget."
13,What's the one invention without which you cannot survive for a day?,Air conditioner. I live in Saudi Arabia where its around 40-48 celsius almost all year except in winter.,The invention I cannot live without for a day is my smartphone.
14,Are my next door neighbours drug makers/dealers?,Sounds like something nefarious is for sure going on,"No, there is no way to answer this question without personal knowledge."
15,"no one messages me first unless they think something is wrong, or need something from me","I'm not sure this is the right subreddit considering there isn't a question involved but.

This is a hard lesson to learn. One I had to learn myself. You deserve to have friends in your life that actually care for you and enjoy your company. Don't settle for simply being tolerated. Don't give people more energy than they're giving you.

I did this myself, I stopped reaching out first. And suddenly I found myself friendless because no one of my friends actually wanted me in their life. I went and got better friends. 

We don't live in a society where it is socially acceptable to tell someone you don't vibe with them, or you don't like them. So a lot of people have friends they only tolerate.","That's understandable. It can be hard to start a conversation, especially if you don't know the other person well. If you're looking to start conversations with people, you could start by commenting on something they posted or by asking how their day is going. You could also try joining an online community or group related to a hobby or interest you have, as that can be an easier way to start conversations with people who have similar interests."
16,How do you cope with watching your parents get old?,"You enjoy them while they're here, and you do the best you can when they are. It's alright to feel sad and to cry about it. You're human and you can't expect to be unphased by something like that. 

>How do you not get consumed by hurt/sadness in moments like this? Aging is natural and there will always be a grief to watching your parents get old. But how do you not get completely consumed by this grief?

You let it flow, and then you realize that life just keeps going anyway. You get back on your feet and you continue to move forward. It's just the way of things. 

Let your grief flow, embrace it. Emotions dissipate with time, and then soon enough you'll be fine again.","It can be very difficult to watch your parents age, but it is important to remember to show them love and respect, no matter what. Remain patient and understanding of their needs and try to spend quality time with them. Be there to listen and offer support when they need it. Consider researching any local resources that may be available to help your parents with any physical or mental challenges they may be facing. Above all, cherish the time you have with your parents and make sure to make the most of it."
17,Is it true “the older you get the less good options there are”?,As I’ve aged the options have improved,"No, this is not true. As you age, you may have more experience and knowledge that can lead to more options and opportunities."
18,"Why is there no ""Middle West"" when Middle East exists?","I would guess geography is the reason Eurasia stretches East-West across a large portion of the globe. With that, there is something of a 'middle' area where the two continents meet. 

In the Western hemisphere, the Americas stretch North South, so the geographic equivalent would be the area referred to as Central America. 

Hope that helps.","The term ""Middle East"" is used to refer to the region of Southwest Asia and North Africa, while the term ""Middle West"" does not have a specific definition. It is sometimes used to refer to the Midwest region of the United States, but it is not an official geographic designation."
19,Do you accept that humans are animals (primates)?,Ignorance of basic science is indeed woefully common.,"Yes, humans are primates, and therefore animals."
20,How do I talk down a medical bill?,"Challenge your insurance (if in U.S.). If they have already processed and paid the claim, ask them about the difference. Start by asking them what the *billed* amount was, then ask what the *allowed* amount was. If they are different, ask why. Some way or another, they should have some way they are able to consider the full allowed amount. 

This is where it gets tricky and depends on plan design. If you have a deductible that you have to meet first, hang up, let it go and yell out a few curse words. If you have full coverage, push them to allow the *entire* billed amount, they should be able to do this somehow, some way. Different companies call it different things, but nearly every carrier has a policy for surprise ambulance billing. Some call it a hold harmless clause, or outlier cost management or something similar, but be very, very pushy about them allowing the full billed amount. Ask for supervisors, demand SPD (full plan breakdown), make them back up their No. If still nothing, go above them. Go to whoever owns the plan, which would likely be your employer, and report it. Or if it's a marketplace plan, call your admin or sales guy and tell them you either want it fixed or your dropping the plan-tell them you feel it's deceptive and you're not going to engage with that type of business.","1. Ask for a written itemized bill. This will help you understand what services were provided and the associated charges.

2. Contact the billing department and request that they lower the bill. Explain your financial situation and ask if there is a payment plan or discount available.

3. If the bill is from a hospital, contact a financial counselor who may be able to help you negotiate a reduced fee or payment plan.

4. Ask if the medical provider will accept a lower payment in full.

5. Consider using a medical bill advocate, who can help negotiate a lower bill on your behalf.

6. If you have health insurance, contact your provider to see if they will cover any of the charges.

7. Research the medical provider’s published fee schedule to compare your bill to the average charge for the same services.

8. Ask if you can pay the bill in installments.

9. See if you qualify for any financial assistance or charity programs.

10. File a complaint with your state insurance department if you feel the bill is not accurate or fair."
21,"What do ghosts ""do"" to you that makes them threatening?",Loitering in my god damn halls without paying no god damn rent,"Ghosts can be threatening in a variety of ways. They may create fear by appearing suddenly and unexpectedly, making strange noises or moving objects, or by appearing in frightening forms such as the Grim Reaper. They may also be threatening by communicating with the living in a threatening manner, such as issuing warnings or making threats."
22,Is there an unspoken rule when writing a book series that you must always reiterate the most basic world or character detail in every book in the series even if they aren't meant to be read separately?,"I don't know what to tell you, except that not _everyone_ reads the same way you and your friends do. Reading in sequence, and re‑reading before a new release, is _fairly common_, but not universal. So authors will often cater to the full wider audience.

Similarly, not every reader is intently devoted to the book they're reading. Sometimes attention lapses into skimming when some part doesn't hold as much interest, or a book is put down for a month or two before coming back to it. Or the reader may just not have a very good memory. So brief internal recaps are designed to refamiliarise key points just before they become necessary to understand the next bit, making a book more of an 'easy read' rather than a demanding one.

But certainly not every book does this. Maybe you need to find different authors who write more to your preferred style.","No, there is no unspoken rule when writing a book series that you must always reiterate the most basic world or character detail in every book in the series, even if they aren't meant to be read separately. It is up to the author as to how much or how little information they want to include in each book. However, it is important to consider the overall story arc, and to ensure that the reader is able to maintain a connection with the characters and the world they inhabit."
23,Why don't Crypto millionaires and billionaires retire?,More like a gambler’s addiction,"Crypto millionaires and billionaires may choose not to retire because they are likely passionate about the cryptocurrency space and want to continue to be involved in the industry. They may also want to continue to grow their wealth or use their resources to benefit the cryptocurrency community. Additionally, they may have a larger goal in mind, such as furthering the adoption of cryptocurrencies or developing new blockchain technology."
24,"ELI5: What is stopping anyone from accruing $100,000 in credit card debt and filing for bankruptcy?","If you have a 100k limit, you dont need 100k that badly.","Bankruptcy is a legal process that erases certain types of debt, but it is not a free pass to avoid paying your debts. There are certain types of debt that cannot be discharged in bankruptcy, such as student loans, child support, alimony, criminal fines, and some taxes. Additionally, creditors can challenge a bankruptcy filing, and if they prove that the debtor had fraudulent intent, the debts may not be discharged. Furthermore, there are limits on the amount of debt that can be discharged in bankruptcy. Generally, the limit is $100,000 in unsecured debt, such as credit card debt. Finally, filing for bankruptcy will affect your credit score and could limit your access to credit in the future."
25,Why am I attracted to women who are damaged/hurt/traumatized,Look up helper syndrome. Might be what you are looking for,"?

It is possible that you are attracted to people who are damaged because you feel a connection to them and understand their pain. This could be because you have also experienced trauma or hurt in your own life. It could also be because you feel a need to help them and protect them. It is important to remember that everyone deserves respect and compassion, regardless of their past experiences."
26,Explain like I’m 5… how do I shower correctly,"You may need some clinical antiperspirant.  That isn't unusual.

Speak to your Dr.","Showering correctly means making sure you get your whole body clean. Start by turning on the water and adjusting the temperature until it is comfortable. Then, wet your body with the water and use soap to lather up your body. Make sure to scrub all the parts of your body, including your hair, face, and under your arms. When you are done, rinse off the soap with the water and turn off the shower."
27,Can someone explain the USA credit system to a European?,"Having too many sources of credit can be bad for you in the US, too. The main thing they're eyeballing is how well you manage your debt, ie that you make payments on time, aren't keeping your credit maxed out, etc. Having something sent to collections, a foreclosure, bankruptcy, and the like will tank your credit.

You don't need to have a credit history to get credit, but you're going to have high interest rates on what credit you *do* get. This isn't such a bad thing on a credit card, so long as you keep it paid off. It does suck mightily if you're looking at a long term loan, such as a house.

There's a lot of benefit to using credit cards for most transactions in the US. Firstly, they provide excellent protection against fraud, which debit cards do not. If someone charges a bunch of things to your DC, you're pretty much shit outta luck. CC, they have your back. Secondly, if you pay off the balance of your credit card each month, there is zero interest charged. Thirdly, many cards provide a cash back program, where they give 1 to 5% cash back to the cardholder on every purchase. It's not a lot, but it certainly adds up over time. Free money.

Lastly, the easiest way in the world to build credit is to put your utilities on autopay to a credit card, and put that card on autopay for the full balance from your checking. You'll build up great credit without even thinking about it.","The USA credit system is a way of measuring an individual's creditworthiness. It is based on a person's credit history, which is a record of their borrowing and repayment habits. This information is collected by the three major credit reporting bureaus—Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion—and is used to generate a credit score. A credit score is a three-digit number that ranges from 300 to 850 and is used by lenders to determine how likely an individual is to pay back a loan. The higher the score, the more likely the individual is to get approved for a loan."
28,Why does the song 'God Bless The U.S.A.' make me emotional even though I'm from the UK?,"Honestly, I think it has more to do with the good writing. I feel like the music could draw emotion regardless of the meaning of the song.","The song 'God Bless The U.S.A.' is an uplifting and patriotic anthem that speaks to the hope and pride that many people in the United States have in their country and its values. Even though you are from the UK, it is likely that you can still appreciate the sentiment behind the song, and it may evoke powerful emotions in you. Additionally, the song has become an anthem for many people around the world, regardless of nationality, as it speaks to the values of freedom, unity, and pride in one's nation."
29,Why can I read words but find it really hard and don't understand what I'm reading?,"Yep you're dyslexic. Have you tried tinted glasses? Get some glasses with either a blue tint or yellow tint, see if that helps.","Reading can be a difficult skill to master, especially if you are not accustomed to it. It may be difficult to understand what you are reading if you are not familiar with the content or don’t have a good understanding of the language. Additionally, if the text contains complex language or concepts, it can be difficult to comprehend. It is important to practice reading regularly and to ask for help if you need it."

31,Why is it so easy to keep drinking but not so easy to stop drinking?,"r/stopdrinking may have some suggestions. There are recovery methods that don't follow the 12 steps, government programs just love the 12 steps because they're cheap.","It can be easy to keep drinking because alcohol is a substance that can be addictive and can cause physical and psychological dependence. Drinking can also become a habit or a coping mechanism. Once someone is accustomed to drinking, it can be difficult to stop because the body is used to the effects of alcohol and may crave it. The withdrawal symptoms that come with quitting drinking can also be intense and difficult to manage."
32,How can some people naturally learn new skills and understand things faster than others?,them be more smarterer,"Some people naturally learn new skills and understand things faster than others due to a variety of factors. These include things like intelligence, natural aptitude, motivation, and access to resources. People who have a higher intelligence level and natural aptitude for a particular skill or subject may have an easier time learning and understanding it. Additionally, people who are highly motivated and have access to good resources, such as tutoring or books, may also learn and understand things faster."
33,Is it weird to go to a bar today by myself for my birthday,"It’s your birthday, so whatever makes you happy!","No, it is not weird. Many people go to bars alone for their birthdays, or to celebrate any other special occasion. It is a great way to spend time with yourself, and you may even meet some interesting people."
34,Why do people like to buy expensive cars?,beats me. they buy them on credit and then are upside the entire time.  I've always bought practical cars and taken my family on trips and life experiences they will grow up to appreciate a lot more than a new X5 every other year.,"People like to buy expensive cars because they are often associated with luxury, status, and power. Expensive cars typically offer more features, better performance, and higher quality materials. They also come with a sense of sophistication and exclusivity that many people find appealing. Additionally, expensive cars can become a source of pride and a symbol of success."
35,Is it just me or do a lot (most?) of people seem to drink alcohol with the sole intention of getting drunk?,Well you don’t drink alcohol for the hydration.,"It is not just you. Many people do drink alcohol with the sole intention of getting drunk. This is especially true for young adults, who often engage in risky behaviors such as binge drinking. Binge drinking is defined as having five or more drinks in a two-hour period for men, and four or more drinks in a two-hour period for women. Binge drinking can lead to serious health consequences and is especially dangerous when combined with other substances."
36,Why do some people use “weird” as a synonym of “morally wrong”?,"Different, other, unusual, eccentric etc. all insinuate deviations from the status quo, some people are so linear, straight edged, ‘as expected’ that they do not have much pliability nor openness to difference.

The why is somewhat subjective and down to the individual.

It’s definitely a limiting mindset and quite frankly isn’t healthy when we consider the reality that we have 8 billion diverse individuals coexisting on this planet.

It’s largely down to environmental conditioning e.g. how someone was raised, what experiences they have had,l etc.","Some people use “weird” as a synonym of “morally wrong” because they view certain behaviors as strange or out of the ordinary. This type of thinking can be based on personal beliefs and values, and can be used to judge or criticize someone else's behavior."
37,Do you think secret agencies bumble into each other every now and then?,"No. There's probably some internal politics, rivalries and so on but I don't think stuff like this happens a lot.

That's just in Hollywood. Reality is just a lot more simple and boring.","It is possible that secret agencies may ""bumble into"" each other from time to time. However, due to the nature of their work, it is likely that any such encounters would be quickly identified and addressed."

39,What to when someone owes you money but won’t pay you?,"You have just learned a valuable lesson, and it cost you the price of a concert ticket. I’m sorry.

Never loan anyone money you can’t live without. 

And if a friend wants to borrow money, either give it to them (so, not a loan) or don’t. Never make it a loan. Because people who need to borrow money are the same people who can’t afford to pay you back. It ruins friendships.","1. Send a formal demand letter. Make sure to keep a copy of the letter for your records. This should include detailed information about the debt, the amount owed, and the date and method of payment.

2. Try to negotiate a payment plan. If the debtor agrees to a payment plan, make sure to get it in writing and keep a copy of it.

40,How would you feel about girl you’re seeing sending bikini pics to another guy?,Major red flags 🚩,I would feel very uncomfortable and betrayed. It would be a violation of trust and I would feel like the girl I am seeing does not respect our relationship.
41,Do you think more people would enjoy their job if they could dress how they want?,"Freedom of expression is part of the reason people like their jobs but if you're doing work that you hate or if you hate your coworkers, being able to wear what you want isn't going to fix that either.","Yes, I believe more people would enjoy their job if they could dress how they want. Allowing people to dress in clothing that is comfortable and reflects their personal style can make them feel more confident and creative in their work environment. It can also help to foster a sense of belonging and community among coworkers."

We have no way of knowing what their intentions are or how they would interact with us. All we can do is hope for the best and be prepared for the worst.
44,How can I meet other 20 to 24 year olds outside of college?,"I realise your question is about friends in general but FWIW a nationally representative 2017 study by Michael Rosenfeld working at Stanford University, found that the most common ways that heterosexual couples met were:

40% online (and rising sharply)  
27% bar/restaurant (and rising)  
20% through friends (and falling)","1. Join a local young professionals group or organization.
2. Attend local networking events or conferences.
3. Join a sports team or recreational group.

45,"If history is written by the victor, how do we know that what we know isn’t just massive embellishments or just outright lies?","Because that’s only mostly true. Most of the time the losers or 3rd parties are not totally annihilated. Like when the Greeks fought the Persians, both civilizations survived these fights and wrote their own accounts of what happened. 

Or like if places A and B went to war, historians from place C would also write about it.

This is why historical data is often given in ranges, best estimates made by accounting for multiple sources","We can look to other sources of evidence to corroborate the historical narrative. This includes archaeological evidence, written accounts from other cultures, and the scientific evidence of climate, environment, and other factors. In addition, historians often use a range of sources to cross-reference and verify the accuracy of the narrative. Finally, historians strive to be impartial and to view the past through multiple lenses to avoid bias and misrepresentations."
46,"If I go into a 30 degree shower when the room temperature is 35 degrees. Will I feel 30 degrees, or 35 degrees?","First of all, we don't feel temperature, we feel temperature difference. Put one hand in cold water, one in warm, then put both in the same luke-warm water and it will feel warm on one hand and cold on the other.

another important factor is heat conductivity. a 20° wood pole will feel warmer than a 20° metal pole, because the metal will transfer the heat away from your skin quicker.

That said, when you shower, you will feel the water, not the air around you, since the water will stick to you and also affect the temperature of the air between the water droplets.","You will feel 30 degrees. The shower will bring the temperature of the room down, but the temperature of the shower will remain the same."
47,How does everyone drink?,"Drink slower as in take smaller gulps, not try to swallow the large gulps slowly

Swallow with less liquid in your mouth","Everyone has different drinking habits and preferences. Some people abstain from alcohol completely, while others may enjoy an occasional drink. Some people may choose to drink beer, wine, liquor, or cocktails at social events or with meals. Everyone should drink responsibly and in moderation."
48,Is there a resource on this site or anywhere on the web that can evaluate a given device concept?,"You can pay a lot of money for buisness analysts and market researchers if you want an estimate.

Noone can tell you how good your product will do.","Unfortunately, there is no single resource that can provide an evaluation of a given device concept. However, there are many resources available that can help you evaluate a given device concept. For example, the USPTO's Design Search Code Manual provides a comprehensive list of design codes that can be used to search for existing design patents. Additionally, the USPTO's Design Search Guide provides guidance on conducting a design patent search. Additionally, the USPTO's Inventors Assistance Center can provide assistance with conducting a design patent search.

50,How did Evangelical Christianity get so powerful in American politics?,"Were that true, we wouldnt have evangelical shitstains in congress trying to push their asinine morality on everyone else.

There’s nobody that proclaims themselves antifa in congress. Plenty of christians.","Evangelical Christianity has become powerful in American politics due to a number of factors. Historically, Evangelical Christianity has been a major force in American politics since the early days of the nation. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Evangelicals were a key part of the Republican Party base. In the 1970s and 1980s, the rise of the religious right further strengthened Evangelical influence. This movement was largely driven by the growth of conservative Evangelicalism as well as the increasing politicization of the abortion issue. The growth of Evangelical Christianity in the United States has also been aided by the fact that it is one of the fastest growing religious groups in the country. This has allowed Evangelicals to gain a larger share of the population and political power. Finally, the rise of the internet and social media has allowed Evangelicals to spread their message and influence more quickly and effectively than ever before."
51,Why do trashmen have to work when it’s raining and snowing?,Cause there's still trash to be picked up.,"Trashmen have to work when it’s raining and snowing because they have an important job to do. Trash collection is necessary for public health and safety, and it must be done even in inclement weather. Trashmen must also wear protective gear to stay safe and dry while working in the rain and snow."
52,What would happen if the Earth suddenly stopped spinning for just one second?,"People at the equator would fly off at about 1,600kph.  That can't be healthy.","If the Earth suddenly stopped spinning for one second, it would cause an immense amount of chaos and destruction. The sudden lack of momentum would cause the atmosphere to rapidly shift, resulting in destructive winds and storms. The oceans would be affected as well, causing huge tsunamis and floods. Furthermore, the lack of gravity would cause objects to fly off the planet, and the planet itself would be thrown off its orbit."
53,Do you think aliens are real? If so based on what theory?,"I think that they’re real because the Universe is so inconceivably big that there is a likely hood that some other life has emerged just as we have. 

Whether those aliens have visited us in spacecraft is less believable no matter what animal skeleton kit-bashes the government keeps showing us.","Yes, I believe aliens are real. There is a vast universe with a multitude of stars and planets, and it would be unlikely for us to be the only living beings in it. Additionally, the Drake equation, which is a mathematical equation used to estimate the number of civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy that could potentially communicate with us, suggests that there could be thousands of intelligent civilizations in our galaxy alone."
54,When you are super bord and nothing is good enough or you're just not in the mood for it what do you do,Do it anyway.,"?

When I'm feeling bored and nothing is entertaining me, I usually try to find a new hobby or activity to do. This could include picking up a new book to read, going for a walk, or trying a new recipe. If I'm still feeling uninspired, I'll try to call up a friend and catch up, or watch a movie or show that I haven't seen yet."
55,What is the best way to make sure elections are legitimate? Question for people who question the previous executive branch election.,"Multiple audits and recounts of any state the loser wants to contest.

Like what happened in 2020, and no election fraud was found, yet people still believe it was fraudulent simply because their loser cult god is mad he lost.","The best way to ensure elections are legitimate is to ensure that all eligible voters have access to the polls, that all votes are counted accurately and fairly, and that all votes are safeguarded from any attempts at fraud. Additionally, it is important to ensure that all candidates have equal access to the ballot and that all voices are heard. This can be accomplished through the use of nonpartisan election monitors, voter education initiatives, and voter protection efforts. Finally, it is important to ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to reach out to voters and that all media outlets are providing balanced coverage of the election."
56,"Are there such things as ""better"" or ""worse"" opinions when it comes to cultural values?",There is no objective good and bad if that's what you're asking.,"Yes, there can be better or worse opinions when it comes to cultural values. Different cultures have different values and beliefs, and people may have different opinions on what is right or wrong in a given culture. Some opinions may be considered better than others based on the values and beliefs of a particular culture."
57,Is it weird to sacrifice hours of sleep to have extra free time?,"It's so normal it has a name- ""revenge bedtime procrastination."" It's 12:30 AM where I live and I am commenting on reddit...","Sacrificing hours of sleep to have extra free time is not necessarily weird, but it can be detrimental to your health and wellbeing if done in excess. It is important to maintain a healthy balance between rest and leisure activities."

59,Why is it close to impossible for a new Reddit account to participate on this platform?,"I agree with you, OP. Reddit is terrible for new accounts. In order to gain some karma, you basically need to comment in r/askreddit and maybe some other low-karma subs for some time.","The main reason why it is close to impossible for a new Reddit account to participate on this platform is because Reddit has a strict anti-spam policy. All new accounts must go through an approval process before they can post or comment on the site. This process can take up to several days and requires a lot of effort from the user. Additionally, Reddit has a reputation system which can make it difficult for new accounts to gain any traction on the site."
60,Is it weird for me to feel uncomfortable around men and dislike male company being a male myself?,"Did you have a traumatic experience in your past caused by one or more men? A lot of women have issues with men (such as father figures or romantic partners) due to past abuse (sexual or otherwise) that can cause them to be aloof and standoffish with them. 

Even if you're man, I feel like this could apply to you as well. I've heard and read stories of men who were sexually assaulted by other men also becoming this way. 

If you don't have a traumatic experience, then you may just have more in common with the women around you than you do other men. Are your interests and hobbies more aligned with those of women than other men? You say you're more introverted with other men and extroverted with women. This might be because you have more in common with women and can enjoy yourself fully while with men, their interests and hobbies might not be for you, hence you're not really enjoying yourself. 

If this is the case, perhaps seek out other men who have those similar interests such as you, and see if you behave the same as you would with your female friends. 

If not of any of the above, then there are still a few other possibilities. 

Did you grow up surrounded by more women than men and hence, feel more comfortable around them? Were you bullied by other boys in school that could have made you more wary of men in general? There are a lot of possibilities honestly.","No, it is not weird at all. Everyone is different and has different preferences when it comes to who they feel comfortable around. If you feel uncomfortable around men and don't enjoy their company, that is perfectly okay."
61,"If a date ditches you with the bill at a restaurant, can you pay for your half and leave?","I think legally you can do that

But generally, don't eat out on a date if you aren't able to cover the bill in a situation like this","Yes, you can. It is always best to be honest and upfront with the waiter or waitress and explain the situation. It is a good idea to pay for your half and then let the restaurant know what happened so they can take appropriate action."
62,Why are pizza places allowed to openly false advertise?,"That's called 'puffery' in legal terms. The law assumes that the average person can figure out that it's just an opinion and not a fact, so it ignores those claims.","Pizza places are allowed to false advertise because the law does not always require businesses to be completely truthful in their advertising. In many cases, businesses are allowed to exaggerate their products or services in order to attract customers. However, businesses must be careful not to make false or misleading claims that could deceive customers."
63,"Who else has felt like they were born with a purpose to do some kind of good, or create some kind of change in the world for as long as they can remember?","""Failed""... you mean practiced?  Keep at it, we need people like you.","Many people have felt this way, and there are many stories of individuals who have gone on to make a real difference in the world. From the famous like Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. to everyday people who have made a difference in their own communities, there are countless examples of people who have taken their sense of purpose and used it to create positive change."
64,is it illegal to ride a horse while intoxicated?,"If the horse is sober, would not it be considered the designated driver?","Yes, it is illegal to ride a horse while intoxicated in most places. Operating a horse while under the influence of alcohol or drugs is a form of reckless behavior and can endanger both the rider and the horse. In some places, it can result in criminal charges."
65,Do people hold up signs in mugshots anymore?,"They can yea. The nameplate will usually have their name, the date, and the police station on it. Usually nothing too significant","No, people do not typically hold up signs in mugshots anymore. In most cases, mugshots are now taken without any props or accessories."
66,Does a cold shower help in warm weather?,"Not at all, cold water is famously a terrible idea when it is hot. It actually makes you hotter.","Yes, a cold shower can help in warm weather. A cold shower can cool down your body temperature and help you feel more comfortable in hot weather. It can also help to reduce sweating and help you feel refreshed."
67,"What does "" X% less "" mean?","A=0.6 and B=1.0.

If X is 50% of Y, it's half the size. If cake X is 50% the size of cake Y, then it's half the size.","""X% less"" means that there is a decrease in the amount of something by X percent. For example, if something is ""20% less,"" then it has decreased by 20%."
68,"When you buy groceries online, are the persona shoppers that pick out your products told to grab the worst produce possible, bc you’re unlikely to return it?",It just depends on the store you go to and when you pick up. I’ve often gotten good produce from quality employees when doing pick up orders. Sometimes they’re bad though. Just depends.,"No, online grocery stores usually employ highly trained personnel to select the best quality produce for their customers. They are expected to choose the freshest, highest-quality products available. Some stores also have additional quality checks in place to ensure that customers are getting the best product for their money."
69,How can some people sleep with their head fully under the blanket?,"I always make sure I have one little opening for the oxygen. It looks like I’m completely covered, but I know I’ve left that one little opening","Some people can sleep with their head fully under the blanket by using a technique called the “tuck and roll.” This involves tucking the sides of the blanket around the head and shoulders, and then rolling into a ball shape. This technique helps keep the air trapped around the head and shoulders, creating warmth and comfort."
70,"When you say ‘I won’t answer this without my lawyer’, where do you actually get your lawyer from?","Option 1: Take whoever smuck they offer you (They have to offer you legal aid)

Option 2: Google ""lawyer in local area"" and start calling people","You can get a lawyer from a variety of sources, such as a law firm, a legal aid organization, or a private lawyer. You may also be able to find a lawyer through referrals from friends, family, or other professionals in the legal community."
71,Can you get through watching a 2 hour movie or 3 hour football game on TV without checking your phone?,I could if i tried to but normally i'll at least check some texts,"Yes, I can get through watching a 2 hour movie or 3 hour football game on TV without checking my phone. However, it may be difficult at times, especially if it is a slow moving movie or game. To help combat the urge to check my phone, I would try to find activities to do during the movie or game, such as playing a game or doing a craft."
72,"Vegetarians, do you like the smell of cooking meat?","As a vegetarian, I always say that the smell of cooking meat is the same to me as the smell of fresh latex paint.  They both smell good, but I would never wish to eat either of them.","No, vegetarians typically do not like the smell of cooking meat."
73,Is $40 a lot for a good men’s haircut?,Not a lot for a legitimate barber in a hcol area. I’m in the Bay Area and most are $45+ I’ve found a guy that’s $25 but he like a 7/10. Some cheap places will charge like $12-$15 but are like 3/10. You’re really taking your chances at these,"It depends on where you get your haircut and what the standard price is in your area. In some places, $40 might be considered a lot for a men's haircut, while in other places it might be a reasonable price."
74,Do flat earthers actually believe the planet is flat?,No.,"Yes, some flat earthers do believe that the planet is actually flat. They believe that the world is a flat disc surrounded by a wall of ice, and that the sun and moon are both much closer to the earth than is generally accepted. They also believe that the earth is the center of the universe and that space travel is impossible."
75,"Whats the point of going in person to spectate a car/rally/motorcycle race, if all you do is watch some vehicles pass by every few minuets?",,"Spectating a car/rally/motorcycle race in person can offer a much more immersive experience than watching the race on television. You will get to experience the roar of the engines, the smell of burning rubber and the thrill of the race as the cars speed by. You can also get up close to the cars and drivers, and meet other fans who share your passion. The atmosphere of a live race is something that can't be replicated on television, and is an experience that is truly unique."
76,Is it “offensive” or “sexist” to ask successful women on how they achieve a work-life balance?,"The issue is, as you’ve already noted, that nobody asks men that. It’s assumed that men are free to pursue their careers because their wives take care of their homes and their children.","It depends on the context in which the question is asked. If the question is asked in a respectful, non-judgmental manner, it is not necessarily offensive or sexist. However, if the question implies that women should be more focused on balancing work and life than men, then it could be seen as offensive or sexist."
77,What would be the downside of everyone always wearing masks in crowded places?,,"The downside of everyone always wearing masks in crowded places is that it could lead to a false sense of security. Masks alone cannot protect an individual from contracting a virus, as the virus can spread through contact with surfaces and through the air. Additionally, wearing a mask can be uncomfortable and can cause some people to feel claustrophobic. Furthermore, if masks are not properly worn, they can actually increase the risk of virus transmission."
78,Did every organism decide to die in the Middle East to give it it's abundant oil supply?,,"No, every organism did not decide to die in the Middle East in order to give it its abundant oil supply. The oil supply is a result of natural geological processes such as the formation of sedimentary rock, which contain oil reserves."
79,Mirror should be rebuffed to +2 levels,,"Mirroring is not a recommended practice when it comes to networking, as it can create potential security risks and can lead to network instability. It is recommended that you use a higher level of security, such as firewalls, VPNs, or other security measures to protect your network."
80,Besides just smoking can vaping also cause red redness?,,"Yes, vaping can also cause redness of the skin. This is especially true if the vape liquid contains a high concentration of nicotine, as this can cause irritation and redness of the skin. Additionally, some people may be allergic to certain ingredients in the vape liquid, which can also cause redness."
81,"If we took matter from space and brought it to Earth, increasing the mass of Earth, would that increase the gravity? If so, would it make humanity stronger?","Hi /u/Active_Ad_6901,

This would not make humanity stronger, however, as gravity affects all objects equally. The increase in gravity would make it harder to move around, as it would make it harder for us to lift and carry objects, and it would make it harder to jump and run."
82,Why is 6 foot the ideal for men in the US when 5'10 is the average?,"Hi /u/baveod,

While 5'10 is the average height for men in the US, 6 feet is considered to be the ideal because it is considered to be more attractive and impressive."
83,How do I deal with my sister's BO?,,"The best way to deal with your sister's BO is to talk to her about it in a respectful and understanding way. Let her know that you care about her and want to help her find ways to improve her hygiene. Offer to help her find a deodorant or antiperspirant that works for her, or suggest she takes a shower or bath more regularly. If she is open to it, you can also help her find a dermatologist who can help her determine the cause of her body odor and provide treatment options."
84,Why do my mosquito bites only really itch when it's late and I'm trying to go to bed?,"I'm not sure. Maybe when we are going about our day and our focus is somewhere else, our brain kinda pushes the itching sensation to the back of the line. When you are at rest, during bedtime, there's not much to distract the brain from it so the sensation returns. This might be complete bullshit by the way. I really don't know.","Mosquitoes inject saliva into their victims when they bite, and this saliva contains proteins that can cause an allergic reaction. When you are trying to go to bed, your body is likely to be more relaxed and your body may become more sensitive to the proteins in the saliva. This can cause an increased reaction as well as increased itching."
85,Dealing with flies,"With fruit flies in particular we’ve had good luck with the indoor fly traps that plug in, that blue light is apparently very tempting to the annoying little things.","To deal with flies, you can use fly traps, window screens, and door sweeps to keep them out of the house. You can also use fly swatters or fly strips to kill them. Additionally, you can use natural repellents like cayenne pepper, cloves, and lavender to keep them away. Finally, you can also clean up any food scraps or garbage that may be attracting them."
86,What are the causes of housing market to be a mess?,"This recent explosion in prices is due to ultra low interest during the pandemic causing high demand, and supply chain interruptions causing a crunch in available homes for sale. Before the Great Recession, demand and supply were high until interest rates rose, and those with variable rates couldn't afford their mortgage anymore causing a wave of foreclosures. The influx in supply caused prices to plummet. Supply and demand always determine housing prices.","1. Lack of supply: A shortage of available housing is one of the main causes of a housing market mess. When demand for housing is higher than the available supply, prices increase, which can lead to an unstable market.

2. Poor economic conditions: Economic downturns can cause housing markets to become a mess. When people are unable to find jobs or have their wages cut, they may be unable to make mortgage payments or keep up with rent. This can lead to foreclosures and bankruptcies, which can further destabilize the market.

3. Speculation: When investors purchase properties with the expectation of flipping them for a profit, it can lead to an overinflated market. When the market eventually cools off, these investors are often left holding properties that are worth far less than what they paid.

4. Poor lending practices: Predatory lending practices can lead to a housing market mess, as people are often given loans that they cannot afford. When borrowers default on their loans, it can lead to foreclosures and further destabilize the market.

5. Poor regulations: Poorly enforced regulations can allow investors to take advantage of the market and drive up prices. This can lead to an unstable market and make it difficult for people to find affordable housing."
87,How often do you clean your belly button?,Every single time I shower because I also have a very deep belly button,"Most people do not need to clean their belly button regularly. If your belly button becomes itchy or irritated, you may want to gently clean it with a cotton swab and warm water."
88,Is there a way to easily and safely check a random USB stick or HD found in the street?,"Have an old computer laying around?

Old phone? You can get a USB connector for your phone. Another way","No, there is no easy and safe way to check a random USB stick or HD found in the street. If you choose to do so, you should take extreme caution. Before plugging in the USB stick or HD, scan it with an antivirus program for any malicious software. Also, if you are able to do so, you should check the file system and make sure that it is not corrupted. Additionally, you should not plug the USB stick or HD into a computer without first backing up the data on the device. Finally, you should be aware that the device may contain confidential or sensitive information and you should exercise caution when accessing any data on the device."
89,About to finally try weed for the first time. Is there a certain age that is ok to try it? I’m 13 and I have friends that did it already,"The prevaling thoughts on weed and age right now is you should not do drugs that can alter brain chemistry till your brain is fully formed and stopped/finished growing.
That age is 21 ish.","No. It is illegal and potentially dangerous for anyone under the age of 21 to use marijuana in any form. If you are under the age of 21, it is not recommended that you use marijuana."
90,Good gifts to give somebody who is practicing Judaism?,"Judaism often discourages converts, unless you're marrying a Jew, I think. Interesting she wants to convert, but maybe you could get her something simple like a dreidel or something. 

It might or might not be appropriate to get her something, I'm not Jewish, I've only looked at some Jewish regulations and celebrations before. If she wants to keep kosher, maybe get her a second set of kitchen equipment (dairy and meat can't even be touched by the same serving spoon in Jewish tradition; not the Bible, but Jewish tradition).","1. Menorah

8. Jewish Cookbook
9. Jewish Music CD
10. Judaica Artwork"
91,What episode of desperate housewives was there a crime scene at a house?,,"The episode was ""Bang"" from season 4. It was the second episode in the season. In the episode, a crime scene is set up at the Bolen's house after a murder is committed."
92,How long can someone eat only one nutritious meal every 72 hours and still remain healthy?,If the meal was large enough and contained enough calories and nutrients there shouldn't be a major problem.,"It is not possible for someone to remain healthy if they are only eating one nutritious meal every 72 hours. The body needs regular and adequate nutrition to remain healthy, and eating one meal every 72 hours does not provide the body with enough nutrients to do so."
93,How do I figure out what fashion style suits me?,You try different styles at different shops - maybe bring a friend along for advice.,"Figuring out what fashion style suits you is all about experimenting with different looks and finding out what makes you feel most confident and comfortable. To start, look at fashion magazines, websites, and social media accounts for ideas and inspiration. Pay attention to the colors, fabrics, and silhouettes that you’re drawn to. Then, try out different looks and find what works best for you. Once you’ve found some looks that you like, you can start to build a wardrobe based on the fashion style that you prefer."
94,Do they make eye prosthetics that aren't meant to resemble an eye?,"There was a brief moment when I started using TikTok that the algorithm thought I'd really like watching people with disabilities. I remember a girl without an eye that showed her eye collection, and they were pretty much all decorative.         

I'm subbed to a midget wrestling channel now btw.","Yes, there are a variety of artificial eyes that are not designed to look like a real eye. Some of these prosthetics are made of glass, plastic, or silicone and can be customized with a variety of colors and shapes."
95,"If people aren't allowed to sing the N when it appears in a song, why do artists even use them in their songs?","Always think back to when Kendrick brought up that white girl up on stage to sing a song. Idk wtf he was thinking, what… just skip over the words? Replace the words? I’ve tried to do this by myself in a room alone and it’s incredibly hard, let alone in front of thousands of people WITHOUT messing up the rhythm. Go ahead try it. 

Everyone ganged up on her, even Kendrick. “You can sing everything except one word” then why bring her up? It almost looks explicitly like a trap.  Imagine being asked to recite a Shakespeare poem from memory and then you’re told to remove 10% of the words. 

While the word itself is used in a cultural way amongst black people, in the end it only creates further division and as long as one side can say it and the other side can’t, there will be no progress whatsoever between the strife that black and white people still go through. It’s a never-ending cycle. You can’t let white people say it, and you can’t let black people NOT say it, so here we are… 

(I’m not defending white people saying the N-word, just pointing out the difficulties it creates by simply letting that atrocious word exist)","Many artists use the N word in their songs to express their opinion on social issues, such as racism, or to show their solidarity with the African American community. It can also be used to emphasize a point or add emotion to a song. While some people may find this offensive, it is ultimately up to the artist to decide how they want to express themselves in their music."
96,Why peoples are getting degooglized nowadays?,Is that like a sex thing?,"People are getting degooglized nowadays because they are becoming more aware of the amount of data Google collects about them. Many people are concerned that their personal data is being used to target them with ads and can be used without their permission. Additionally, people are increasingly concerned about Google's privacy policies, its use of artificial intelligence, and its lack of transparency. As a result, many are turning to alternatives such as DuckDuckGo, StartPage, and private search engines."

Why do i use this behaviour?,"Not a lot of detail, so can anyone here really know?",It is likely that you are using this behaviour as a way to cope with difficult emotions or situations.

But not nearly as bad as it was in the 90s.,"No, the current border crisis is not as bad as it has been in the last 20-30 years. In the 1990s and early 2000s, there were much higher levels of illegal immigration into the United States, with an estimated 12 million undocumented immigrants living in the country in 2007.

116,Why am I suddenly Dreaming every Night?,"It might be the caffeine, but it's more likely that you always dream, and now you are remembering the dreams better.

It could be due to changes in your environment, such as a new job or move, or a change in your routine. It could also be due to emotional or psychological stress, such as a traumatic experience or a difficult life event.

118,Do millionaires also take loans/mortgages on a property?,"I'm technically a millionaire, but not a *multi*-millionaire. But I know enough about the financial world to answer your question.

It depends. If someone bought a house for $50 million, they probably didn't dump that much real cash into the purchase. They probably have a mortgage loan, though a special one with better terms than you or I could get.

But if it's a smaller place (to them), like a vacation home, then yeah, they probably bought it outright. A lot of wealthy people uses these as investment properties. Buy at one price, rent out at a premium for a few years, then sell at a higher price.","Yes, millionaires can take out loans and mortgages on a property, just like anyone else. It is important to remember that even though someone is a millionaire, they may still need to take out a loan or mortgage to purchase real estate."
119,"Over a year and a half later, what are your thoughts on the war in Ukraine?","Russia's still an asshole and I would rather nobody fight but, as per Russia, that's just not in the cards.

I'm glad the US (and others) have offered military aid to Ukraine, if for no other reason than it keeps to war contained to an area I don't live in and prevents/minimizes, in my case, american servicemen from being deployed there to fight and die.  Sounds callus, but it's not like there's anything I can do to *stop* the war, that's all on russia and we're not offering military aid to them, so ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯","My thoughts on the war in Ukraine are that it is an unfortunate and devastating conflict that has caused immense suffering to the people of Ukraine. The war has been a major humanitarian crisis, resulting in thousands of deaths, displacement of millions of people, and a breakdown of the economy. Despite numerous attempts at peacemaking, the situation remains unresolved and the war continues to rage on. It is essential that the international community continues to work towards a peaceful resolution and that all parties involved in the conflict find a way to peacefully coexist."
120,What’s a part time job that can help pay off my student loans?,"When I graduated, I took the opportunity to live rent free with the parents for a year.

121,AITA for not telling my best friend my sister is having a baby?,"Sounds like you all need to grow up a bit.

You are all the assholes for still acting like you’re in high school.",Not AITA. It's understandable that you would want to keep this news to yourself for a while. You don't owe your friend any explanation; it is up to you when and how you tell them.
122,Can anything bad happen if I brag about scamming my landlord on social media?,"Setting aside that you just did brag about it on social media, why would you want to?  It gains you nothing, it's just meaningless dick-waving.","Yes, bragging about scamming your landlord on social media can have serious consequences. Depending on the jurisdiction, it may be considered a criminal offence and could lead to fines, jail time, or both. It may also damage your reputation and make it difficult for you to rent from other landlords in the future."
123,I just saw a vehicle that had a large tarp draped from the head rests in the back seat of a car. Why would someone do that?,Sometimes those are for dogs. For they won’t get fur everywhere,"It's possible that the person was trying to cover up something in the back seat, or they may have been transporting something that needed to be covered up to keep it from getting damaged. It's also possible that the person was simply trying to keep the sun off of the back seat and keep the car cool."
124,"Are tanks becoming obsolete in modern warfare, even the Leopard tanks got smoked!?",Tanks are not obsolete.  They still support infantry.  You can't occupy territory using rockets.,"No, tanks are not becoming obsolete in modern warfare. While the Leopard tanks may have had some difficulty in certain situations, tanks remain an important part of modern warfare. Tanks are still used in a variety of ways, from providing direct fire support to acting as a mobile barrier to protect troops and equipment. In addition, tanks are being equipped with advanced technology, such as active protection systems and advanced fire control systems, to make them more effective on the battlefield."
125,What were some of your favorite childhood toys?,"Hi /u/LogicalRun3620,

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

However, there are some strategies you can use to help refresh your mind and increase your productivity. Examples include taking a break, getting enough sleep, exercising, eating healthy, and meditating. Additionally, engaging in activities that bring you joy, such as reading, art, listening to music, or spending time in nature can help to reduce stress and improve cognitive performance."
127,For a few weeks my tires had a slow leak and I had to pump them up every 2-3 days. Now they’re fine and hold air for weeks without me pumping any air into them; what gives?,Temperature plays into tires losing/keeping air.,"It is likely that the slow leak was caused by a puncture or a damaged valve stem. Over time, the air pressure would slowly leak out of the tire. By pumping up the tires regularly, you were able to keep the air pressure at an acceptable level. However, the puncture or valve stem damage was still present, and eventually it may have sealed itself or the puncture may have been plugged. If the problem persists, it is best to have the tires inspected by a professional."
128,What's the best way to get home Internet without cords?,"You could get mobile internet, or wireless internet.

Mobile internet can be costly and unreliable... Basically, you know how your phone has internet? You can get a thing that uses the same kind of internet, but for your house. You could also use your phone itself to supply your pc and consoles and stuff with internet

Wireless internet is something I didn't know existed until I almost got a job at a company that does it. Basically, instead of using wires, this uses two dishes that communicate with each other wirelessly. The upside is that you don't need to lay cables. The company I was looking at was mostly covering a bunch of farms that are too far from each other to make cables cost effective. The down side is you need line of sight from your house to an antenna the company has up. ([found it on Wikipedia under ""fixed wireless ""](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_wireless))","The best way to get home internet without cords is to use a wireless internet connection, such as Wi-Fi or cellular data. Wi-Fi is the most common option, and is available in most homes and businesses. Cellular data is also an option, though it may be more expensive and have slower speeds than Wi-Fi."
129,Moving Out - What do I need?,"I assume you already have clothes, so the big four are food, sleep, hygiene, and leisure.  

You need to be able to prepare, eat, and store food - so at least some pots and pans, cooking utensils, plates, glasses, bowls and eating utensils.  

You need to have a place to sleep, so bed (or at least mattress or even a cot so you're not just sleeping on the floor), bedclothes like sheets, blankets and the like.

Hygiene to clean yourself (soap, shampoo, towels, toothbrush/paste, etc) as well as your place (broom, surface cleaners for kitchen and bathroom, at least a shitty vacuum if you have carpets, at least a shitty mop for the hard floors, etc).

And leisure is kind of a catch-all for anything that isn't directly related to survival, like couch, chairs, tables, TV, books, etc.","1. Moving boxes and packing materials: You'll need plenty of moving boxes, bubble wrap, packing tape, packing paper, and other materials to safely pack your items.

2. Moving truck: Depending on the size of your move, you may need to rent a moving truck or van to transport your items. 

3. Moving help: If you're not able to lift and move heavy items on your own, consider hiring movers to help you.

4. Cleaning supplies: Make sure you have all the necessary cleaning supplies to clean your old place before you move out.

5. Change of address form: Don't forget to update your address with the post office and other important organizations.

130,What happens to people that cannot feel pain when they get hit in the liver or solar plexus?,They don't feel the pain.,"If someone cannot feel pain when they get hit in the liver or solar plexus, they are at risk of not recognizing the severity of the injury and not seeking timely medical attention.

131,Why do people get aroused from drawings if the want for is sex caused by the instinct to reproduce?,Instincts aren't that smart. You are basically fooling your instincts.,"People can become aroused from drawings because visual images, such as drawings, can be stimulating and evoke sexual desire. This can be caused by a combination of factors, including a person’s individual preferences, cultural influences, and biological responses. It is possible for people to become aroused by drawings even without the explicit intention of reproducing, as sexual desire and pleasure can be experienced without the drive to reproduce."
132,How realistic is it for me to move out at 18?,"As long as you have a plan laid out it's definitely doable. Most decently paying jobs require a degree, the jobs that don't require college degrees require you to work several years before getting paid a decent wage. From experience, all salary jobs required degrees and all hourly jobs only require High School graduate.","It is very realistic for you to move out at 18, provided you have a stable source of income and a place to live. However, make sure that you are prepared for the financial and other responsibilities that come with living independently. You should also consider the amount of support you will receive from family and friends, as well as the availability of resources in your area."
133,Does welding gloves make for good oven gloves?,"The thick, high heat gloves definitely can. 

I would be very hesitant to use light fabrication gloves though. The thin leather types used more for things like tig welding and torch (oa) welding.","No, welding gloves are not designed for use as oven gloves. They are designed to protect the user from extreme heat and sparks, but they are not designed for direct contact with hot surfaces. Oven gloves are designed to be heat resistant and flame retardant, which welding gloves are not."

136,How do you make peace with rejection (specially when it came from a girl you really liked),"Everyone gets rejected. Maybe you've done some rejecting yourself.

It's normal. I really liked a couple of girls recently. They're unavailable and rejected me. That's life.

Some girl invited me to a party, she was expecting me to do something with her. I didn't feel that way. I went to the party but I didn't like her that way. I rejected her.","1. Acknowledge your feelings: It's important to be honest with yourself about how you feel and to give yourself permission to feel the emotions that come with rejection. 

2. Talk to someone you trust: Talking with someone who you trust can help you process your feelings and gain some perspective.

3. Take time for self-care: Make sure you’re taking care of yourself by getting enough rest, eating healthy, and engaging in activities that bring you joy.

4. Practice self-compassion: Remind yourself that rejection is a normal part of life and that you’re not alone in feeling this way.

5. Reframe your thinking: Instead of dwelling on the rejection, focus on the positives in your life and the things that you can control.

6. Let it go: Try to accept that the rejection is out of your control and focus your energy on the things that make you happy."

138,Why isn't goat more included in western menus and cooking?,"Goat is more expensive/difficult to raise on an industrial scale, than chicken, beef, pork, or sheep.  Its basically just comes down to profit margin.","Goat is not as popular in western menus and cooking because it is not as widely available in western countries as it is in other parts of the world. Additionally, there is a lack of familiarity and understanding about how to cook goat in western culture, as well as a lack of knowledge about its nutritional benefits."
139,Hogwarts Legacy on Switch,,"At this time, there is no confirmed release of Hogwarts Legacy on the Nintendo Switch."
140,Hairdressers of Reddit,Not a hairdresser: Who cares what your hairdresser thinks on a day to day basis?,", what is the most annoying thing you experience on a daily basis?

The most annoying thing I experience on a daily basis is clients who come in late and expect their appointment to still be honored. This can be very disruptive to the rest of the day's schedule, as the late client's appointment time then needs to be taken away from another client who was on time. It's also a huge waste of time, as the client may not even be able to get the service they wanted due to the time constraint."
141,Is there a website that helps quickly improve basic numeracy?,"XtraMath.org is designed for teachers to give students exercises. What that means is you'll have to create an account as if you were a teacher, then use your teacher account to create a student login and use the student login to practice.","Yes, there are a number of websites that offer resources to help improve basic numeracy. Khan Academy is a popular website that offers free online lessons in math, including basic numeracy. Other websites, such as Mathway and Math Planet, also offer resources to help improve basic numeracy."
142,"What is a care package, and how do you go about making one?","A care package is generally just a package of things you think the person needs or wants. Generally, this includes your favorite chocolates and treats. Sometimes, they'll include stuff like warm socks or gloves. If you're somewhere cold, or in winter. 

People who move to another country will often get these themed with things the new country don't sell (like specific types of chocolate). People who move out and into dorm rooms often get these because they don't tend to have the most money so sending them straight up food is sometimes the best way to make sure they're eating and not wasting all their money on booze. 

""care package"" could mean just about anything. An parent could put together a care package to their daughter who is coming into her periods. Including period products, maybe a safe-sex brochure and condoms. Stuff that would be incredible embarrassing for the daughter to get from their parents so they can just leave it in their bedroom and pretend it never happened

It is basically just a gift, but instead of one big thing its usually a few smaller things.","A care package is a box of items sent to someone as a sign of love and appreciation. Care packages can be sent to show support during a difficult time, or just to let someone know they are being thought of. Care packages can be created with items that are meaningful to the recipient, or simply with items that are helpful and enjoyable. Some examples of items to include in a care package are: books, snacks, cards, magazines, puzzles, toiletries, and other small gifts. To create a care package, start by selecting items that are meaningful to the recipient. Next, package the items in a box or bag. Lastly, write a heartfelt note to the recipient to show them how much you care."
143,"As a male employee who cleans the women’s restroom, what’s the least awkward way to make sure it’s empty before I enter?","Knock on the door and say ""Cleaning guy coming through! Anyone in there?""","The best way to make sure the restroom is empty before entering is to knock on the restroom door and politely ask if anyone is inside. If there is no response, you can then enter and begin cleaning. It is important to be respectful when entering and leaving the restroom."
144,What about the cameras,"Capturing footage during the atomic bomb tests in the 1940s and 1950s was indeed a challenging and risky task.   
  
The cameras were placed at a considerable distance from the blast to minimize the impact of the explosion and radiation. Remote-controlled cameras were often used to capture footage from safer locations.  
  
The camera operators and equipment were often shielded with lead or other radiation-blocking materials to reduce exposure to harmful radiation.  


Special high-speed cameras were used to capture the rapid events of the explosion. These cameras could record at thousands of frames per second, allowing for the capture of slow-motion footage.  
  
 Film stock used for these tests was often thicker than standard film to make it more resistant to damage from radiation and heat.  
  
Film rolls were quickly retrieved from the testing area after the explosion to minimize exposure to radiation.  
  
While the cameras and film were exposed to significant radiation and other hazards, the precautions taken, along with the use of specialized equipment, allowed for the capture of valuable footage that contributed to our understanding of nuclear weapons and their effects. However, it's worth noting that some footage may have been damaged or degraded due to radiation exposure, and not all cameras survived intact.","?

The cameras can be set up to provide a live stream of the event or to record it for later viewing. Additionally, many event venues have their own surveillance cameras that can be used to provide additional security and monitoring."
145,This USB drive does not work. Is the “storage part” missing or is there just something that needs to be fixed? Is it possible to tell just by looking at it?,That's a memory card reader.,"It is not possible to tell just by looking at the USB drive if the ""storage part"" is missing or if there is something that needs to be fixed.

146,Can cats or dogs tell when you trick them to get your seat back?,,"No, cats and dogs cannot tell when you are tricking them to get your seat back. They may be able to sense that something is different, but they cannot tell that you are purposely trying to trick them."
147,how should i go about letting my boss know i can't open tomorrow morning (it's 12:06am now) because of a domestic abuse incident?,"I would text now, say it’s a family emergency or personal situation. You don’t have to share anything else. But letting him have that text first thing will allow him to plan accordingly.","It is important to be honest and straightforward when speaking to your boss about a domestic abuse incident. You can explain that you are not able to come into work tomorrow morning due to a domestic abuse incident and that you need to take some time to focus on your safety and well-being. You should provide your boss with whatever information you feel comfortable sharing, and then let them know that you will be in touch once you have the details sorted out.

148,"How is it possible that I can be absolutely knackered, completely comfortable and within my normal sleeping hours and still fail to fall asleep? Sometimes for hours on end, for example tonight I went to bed around midnight and it's now nearly 9am and still can't sleep","It sounds like you have pretty bad insomnia, much worse than me, so my advice might not be that helpful but here it is anyway.

I’ve also been recommended to try all the things that you have been, and I found that none of them worked. But there were two reasons for that - one is that I was only trying one/a few of them in isolation, and the other is that I didn’t stick with them for long enough before having a bad nights sleep and despairing again. The key to this is without a doubt consistency. Do ALL of these things, EVERY day, and you will likely see results. The things I found most helpful were:

- wake up/go to bed at the same time every day, even weekends
- exercise every day
- don’t eat too late
- sleep in a slightly colder room (this has a scientific basis)
- absolutely no caffeine (very hard when you’re sleep deprived I know)
- practise mindfulness in bed (and even during the day). Often the main thing keeping me up is my thoughts, and I can’t shut down even when I go to bed. It’s counterintuitive, but I need to focus really hard on not thinking about anything, so that my brain is free to shut down. I find it helpful to count backwards from 10 in slow, deep breaths, and mentally onto noting when you mind wanders. Look this up and find something that works for you though.

Best of luck my friend.",".

There are a variety of reasons why this could be happening. It could be due to stress or anxiety, or it could be because of an underlying medical condition such as insomnia or sleep apnea. As well, certain medications or substances can interfere with sleep. It could also be due to an irregular or unhealthy sleep schedule. Finally, it could be due to environmental factors such as noise or too much light in the bedroom. It is important to talk to a doctor if this is a recurring problem, as they can help determine the cause and provide the best treatment options."
149,Why does a court believe in “innocent proven guilty”? Isn’t it human nature to believe the other way around?,"Because we as a society see how thats problematic.

You really want to be assumed guilty by everyone anytime someone accuses you of something??",The phrase “innocent until proven guilty” is a cornerstone of the criminal justice system and is based on the presumption of innocence. This means that all individuals are presumed to be innocent of any crime until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. This principle is intended to protect individuals from being unjustly convicted of a crime and is designed to ensure that individuals are not treated as though they are guilty until they can prove their innocence. It is based on the idea that it is better for a guilty person to go free than for an innocent one to be wrongly convicted.

151,Why do we have the instinct/impulse to save complete strangers?,"Evolution. We evolved to be tribal/social animals, which gives us the natural instinct to care about and want to help other people.

It is beneficial for our species to help those in need, as it can lead to increased social cohesion and a greater likelihood of successful reproduction. Additionally, our instinctive response to save strangers may be linked to our empathy, as we may feel the same emotions as the person in need and thus feel compelled to help them."

158,If I wanted to put candle wax on a wood block what would happen?,"You can do a thing where you can hit the wax with a flame or hot air to get it to soak in more, but, it will remain fragile and soft for all time.

Instead, for cutting blocks, I suggest a treatment of a ""drying"" oil, like walnut oil, or linseed oil (but not boiled linseed oil, as the catalysts are spooky) In time, air hardens it a little, but not until after it has a chance to soak in. After that, the block can mostly be treated with a small amount of food-grade mineral oil.","If you put candle wax on a wood block, the wax will harden and form a protective layer on the surface of the wood block. The wax will help to protect the wood block from moisture, dirt, and other elements, while also adding a decorative touch to the wood block."

163,Why do hockey players love fighting more than playing the game?,"Relevant: 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9281541

Results

Fights per game decreased from a peak of 0.64 in 2002 to a low of 0.18 in 2020, while average attendance increased from a low of 16,549 in 2004 to a peak of 17,768 in 2013, before settling between 17,400 and 17,500 during the final three seasons of the study period. A significant negative correlation was found between attendance and fights per game (R = −0.6617, p = 0.0020). There was a positive, but not significant correlation between attendance and goals per game (R = 0.2457, p = 0.3105). A significant inverse correlation existed between goals per game and fights per game (R = −0.521, p = 0.0222).

Conclusions

NHL fighting rates have diminished during the past two decades, while fan attendance has increased. A significant negative correlation exists between fan attendance and fights per game, casting doubt on fighting's entertainment value. Meanwhile, a significant inverse correlation was noted between goals per game and fights per game. Taken together, these findings suggest fans may prefer higher scoring and less violent competitions. We conclude by suggesting that prohibiting fights in the NHL could improve player safety without negatively impacting fan attendance.","Hockey players fight for many reasons, such as to stand up for a teammate, to intimidate the opposition, to express frustration, or to change the momentum of the game. Fighting is also seen as a sign of toughness and strength, and a way to prove oneself on the ice. Additionally, fighting can be seen as a way to entertain fans and add to the excitement of the game."
164,Should I be afraid of gators on Florida golf courses,"In Florida it is taught any body of water big enough to have a gator in it could have one in it. So it's best to keep your distance.

167,Can anyone explain the origin of God Shammgod’s name?,,"God Shammgod is a basketball player who was known for his incredible ball-handling skills. He was given the name “God” by his high school teammates because of his skill. The “Shammgod” part of his name was added later, after his professional debut in the NBA.

168,Why wasn’t airport security strict before 9/11 anyways?,"It was quite strict, it just didn't stop the terrorists. Everything since then has been what's called ""security theatre"": there is zero evidence that it has made flying any safer (and in fact there is plenty of evidence that it would fail in exactly the same way again), it's just designed to make you *think* the authorities are making flying safe for you.

The real security is actually going on behind the scenes. There is one important thing that 9/11 has changed: before then if somebody hijacked a plane, pilots would comply with the hijacker's demands because passenger safety was the most important thing. Now that's changed, and pilots will refuse to do what a hijacker demands even if they start torturing and killing passengers.","Prior to 9/11, airport security was not as strict as it is today because of the lack of understanding of the potential threats posed by terrorists. The events of 9/11 changed the way we view airport security and forced us to take a closer look at the measures we have in place to ensure the safety of passengers and staff. Since then, airport security has become much more rigorous and involves the use of advanced technology to detect potential threats."
169,"If disney makes another steamboat willie movie, can they extend their copyright?","Short answer is no.

The original production would still enter public domain while the new production would get a shiny new copyright.  Either they re-release the original which does nothing or they re-make the original which is a novel work with it's own separate copyright.

Making new versions ""extends"" the copyright because the new versions are what people will grow up experiencing and that's *that's* what would drive their creative efforts, not the original which they've never seen.  But I've never actually heard that as a motivation before.  

What I have heard is *contracts,* not copyright.  Often times a company buys the exclusive rights to an intellectual property for a period of time and they're either looking to cash in right before the contract ends or the contract requires them to be actively developing the intellectual property or they lose it.  Either way, they push out some piece of shit movie because it's their last chance to do so after sitting on the IP for so long.","No, Disney cannot extend their copyright on Steamboat Willie. Copyright protection for works published in the United States is limited to the life of the author plus 70 years. Since Walt Disney died in 1966, the copyright on Steamboat Willie will expire in 2036."

171,When does something transition from being Art to being purely downright offensive? Is there a place where nobody could dispute it? Or will there always be someone arguing something is Art?,"Everybody has a line where that definition lays.

It is important to be honest and open about your past, so that your partner can make an informed decision about whether or not your relationship is right for them."
175,What does the process of making friends look like?,"There are a few things to consider when trying to make friends. The first is that not everyone is looking to be your friend, which is their own loss, if you can handle a bit of rejection it makes everything a lot easier. 

Another is that you have to make different friends for different scenarios, not everyone feels comfortable with new things (You wouldn't want to make a gaming friend and force them to go for a hike if they had no interest in it).

But to answer your actual question and break it down into steps:

1. Think of interests you have that others may share, no matter how small or big.
2. Try to find a situation where a group of people that have that interest would be together.
3. Go to that meetup or group and try talking to people about the interest, and be honest about being there to make new friends.
4. If you are having an actual conversation (as in all participants are talking, including yourself, try to add to the conversation.) then ask the person for their contact details
5. Continue chatting to the person, they're now your friend.

For example, I like cultures and languages:

When I see anyone that is foreign, I ask them where they're from.

If I know any of their language I try to say hello to them in that and tell them that I have been looking for new friends to help me practice speaking (insert language).

If I don't know their language I ask if they can teach me how to say ""hello, thank you and goodbye"" then I tell them that I'd like to learn more if they'd be willing.

Then I would introduce myself and say my name and ask them questions to get to know them, their name, their age, what their hobbies are (looking for other overlap). And giving them time to respond and ask a questions. If they are asking questions back, then odds are you've made a new friend, if not they could just be shy around strangers so you can offer up information about yourself so that they're more comfortable feeling like they know you.

I can then ask them if they're willing to give me any form of communication: phone number, snapchat, discord, email, fax, pager, whatever. And they can decide what the most comfortable form of communication would be.

&#x200B;

Another example for me as a gamer:

If there was a local convention or competition, then I could go to that, participate and between panels/games try to chat to people. Most gamers don't mind giving out their usernames to party up in the future, so it's okay to ask pretty much instantly ask someone what platform they play on and if they're looking for new friends.

&#x200B;

I feel like all of my suggestions are a little bit extroverted, so I'll give an example now on how to make friends as a gamer without leaving your house, and another method that can be applied to any hobby, but I'll again use gaming as an example.

For matchmaking games, you can just let yourself randomly fill and try to make conversation with your randoms, then ask them if they'd like to continue playing in the future and add them to your friends list.

For any hobby, you can go on a forum, or the subreddit, find people posting and if you comment on the posts and share your opinions and try to make a conversation with someone. For gaming personally I would use discord and try to find a server related specifically to the game, then I'd make conversation with the people in that server, and try to learn about them.","1. Introductions: Start off by introducing yourself and getting to know the other person. Ask questions about their interests, hobbies, and background.

2. Conversation: Once you’ve broken the ice and gotten to know each other a bit, start talking about other topics. Discuss your thoughts and opinions on different topics.

3. Common Interests: Find out what you have in common. Whether it’s a shared hobby, favorite sports team, or similar values, finding something you both enjoy talking about will help build a connection.

4. Hang Out: Invite your new friend to do something together. It could be anything from grabbing lunch to going to a movie.

5. Stay in Touch: Keep in touch with your new friend. Exchange phone numbers, or talk online. Make plans to hang out again and keep the friendship going."

Credit cards are typically issued by banks and other financial institutions and are accepted by merchants that have agreed to accept them. When the cardholder makes a purchase using a credit card, the merchant submits the transaction to the card issuer for payment. The card issuer then pays the merchant and charges the cardholder's account for the purchase amount. The cardholder must then pay the card issuer the amount charged, plus any applicable interest and fees."

The ship should also be equipped with advanced navigation and communication systems to ensure safety and to stay on course. Additionally, it should have a fire suppression system and fire-resistant materials to protect against any potential fire hazards. Finally, the ship should have lifeboats and other lifesaving equipment in case of an emergency."

2. Get tested for STIs: If you’re at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), your doctor may recommend that you get tested before getting an IUD. 

3. Get your pelvic exam: Your doctor will also need to do a pelvic exam before inserting an IUD. This exam helps the doctor determine the size and shape of your uterus and make sure there are no abnormalities. 

4. Talk to your doctor about your period: It’s important to talk to your doctor about your menstrual cycle before getting an IUD. This will help your doctor determine the best time to insert the IUD. 

5. Ask about pain relief: Ask your doctor what type of pain relief you can take before and after your IUD insertion. 

6. Make sure you have someone to drive you home: You should arrange for a friend or family member to drive you home after your IUD insertion. 

7. Follow your doctor’s instructions: After the IUD is inserted, your doctor will give you instructions about how to care for the IUD and when to come back for follow-up appointments. Make sure to follow these instructions carefully."
193,How did astronomers figure out that the air outside of space is unbreathable before sending the first person to space?,"""Pascal performed a public demonstration at a fair of the effects of altitude on a column of mercury, and surmised existence of a vacuum above the atmosphere in 1648. And soon Hooke presented an estimate of how far the atmosphere extends in Micrographia (1665), after conjecturing the inverse square law for gravity."" https://hsm.stackexchange.com/questions/2389/who-was-the-first-to-postulate-that-space-was-a-vacuum#:~:text=Pascal%20performed%20a%20public%20demonstration,inverse%20square%20law%20for%20gravity.

So essentially Pascal showed that air pressure got less and less as you went higher, and correctly assumed that it would hit 0 at some point. Hooke calculated the force of gravity and how it lessened over distance in order to determine where the air pressure would become 0.",Astronomers were able to determine that the air outside of space is unbreathable by studying the composition of the Earth's atmosphere and the vacuum of space. They used this information to calculate the pressure and temperature of the air outside of Earth's atmosphere and concluded that it would be impossible to breathe.
194,Why do we (human/living thing) need to become unconscious in order to get rest?,"I don't know much about biology, but I've always assumed that it was because the brain is a very complex organ that uses a lot of energy. So, in order for our body to truly be able to rest and heal, we need to temporarily ""pause"" the brain so that the energy can be diverted to our other organs for their necessary processes.","Becoming unconscious (sleeping) is essential for our physical and mental health. During sleep, our bodies have time to restore and repair cells, tissues, and organs. It also helps us to process and store memories, consolidate our learning, and regulate our hormones. Additionally, sleeping helps to reduce stress, improve our mood, and increase our energy levels."
195,How do you forget about a former best friend who ghosted you?,Time. It's tough but nothing you can do about it. Trust me I've been there.,"1. Acknowledge and accept your feelings. It is important to validate your emotions and allow yourself to feel the hurt and sadness that may come with being ghosted by a former best friend.

2. Work on self-care. Take time for yourself to do things that make you feel good and help you relax. Spend time with supportive friends and family, exercise, meditate, listen to music, or take up a new hobby.

3. Reach out to others. Talk to a trusted family member, friend, or mental health professional about what you are going through. Talking about it can help you process your feelings and gain perspective.

4. Give yourself time and space. Don’t rush yourself to “get over” what happened. Allow yourself to heal at your own pace.

5. Focus on the present. Try not to dwell on the past and the person who ghosted you. Instead, focus on the present and the things that bring you joy and happiness."
196,What does it mean when someone says that they can make friends easily but find it difficult to sustain those friendships?,"Sounds like an extravert characteristic. Classically, extraverts have many friends but more superficially. Introverts tend to have fewer friends but deeper relationships with them. Extraverts need a lot of stimulation, so inclined to seek new people. Introverts are easily overwhelmed by too much stimulation so more likely to be happier to stick with someone they know and gradually get to know them better.","It means that the person is able to establish relationships quickly, but struggles to maintain them over time. This could be due to a number of factors, including difficulty with communication, trust issues, or a lack of commitment to the friendship."

198,[GA] Question about Protecting My Daughter's Well-being in a Challenging Custody Situation,/r/legaladvice,"Your first step should be to contact a family lawyer in your area.

what would you do if a classmate stood in front of the class and suddenly freeze up? 
most people show empathy or simply don't care. it takes a lot of pressure from you knowing that everyone has been in a situation they felt uncomfortable and insecure with.

I've been to a job interview a couple weeks back and since I think to myself ""everyone's been nervous before; it's part of being human"" I come across more confident.

Also try to shift your perspective from seeing it as a negative experience to a chance to grow and learn something new.","1.

But my neck? Boyyyyy my neck is the place to BE!

So having different hot spots is normal, but if you have NO hot spots that might be an.. medical issue or something?","The insides of your thighs may not be as sensitive as other parts of the body because the skin in this area is thicker and less exposed to external stimulation. Additionally, the nerve endings in this area may not be as densely packed as other areas of the body, making it less sensitive."
203,what would happen to your home (owned out right) if you reccieved a whole life sentance in prison,It'll sit unused. You'd still have to pay property taxes though.,"If you receive a whole life sentence in prison, your home would likely go into foreclosure if you are unable to make the mortgage payments.

Some people will win large amounts of money, most won't. You *can* make $10,000 a month by playing gambling games, it's just very unlikely that you will.

It's profitable for the app owner because they will take in a lot more money in player payments (and possibly advertising revenue) than they will have to pay out in prize money.","Solitare Cash type apps work by allowing users to win real money by playing solitaire. These apps typically use a form of sweepstakes or contests, where users can enter and win cash prizes. The app will usually require users to pay an entry fee to enter the sweepstakes or contest, and the amount of money that can be won will depend on the number of entries. The app will then use a random number generator to determine the winner of the cash prize."

Nerves are able to detect subtle changes in the environment and quickly respond to them. They can also carry out more complex tasks such as relaying information from one part of the body to another or even from one brain to another.

Primarily it’s the older generation. Sometimes younger white dudes give me a dirty look as well.","It depends on the situation.

I don't get why you think our digestive system is weak when it's actually quite powerful","Humans have a weak digestive system compared to other animals because of our diets. We eat a much more varied and processed diet than other animals, and this has caused our digestive system to be less efficient at breaking down and extracting nutrients from the foods we eat.

This means that students take a set number of courses over a set amount of time (usually two semesters over the course of a year).

Ecological Niche: Canines (members of the Canidae family) occupy a particular ecological niche as carnivorous predators. Their physical features, like sharp teeth, claws, and a keen sense of smell, have evolved to suit this niche. Other animals that occupy a similar niche may evolve similar traits for hunting, scavenging, or feeding on similar prey.

263,Why does space look empty from photos taken in orbit but pictures taken on earth can show a sky full of stars and even the Milky Way?,Probably (since I don't which particular photo's you mean) exposure time. Fast exposure time means less light which means less visible stars. Actual astrophotography generally uses longer exposure times to allow more fainter stars to register. Photo's from places like space stations or shuttles are more likely personal camera's with normal fast shutter speeds. Which are great for close objects not so good for tiny points of light.,"From photos taken in orbit, space appears empty because the camera is too far away from the stars and other celestial objects to pick up on their light. On Earth, the atmosphere blocks out most of the light from stars and other celestial objects, so only the brightest stars and the Milky Way can be seen. However, when a camera is taken into space, it is able to capture the light from more distant stars and other celestial objects, which makes space appear much more full and vibrant."

Thus, all 3 people should be paying for their share of the shared spaces. If 3 people are using the kitchen, for example, then why are you paying for half of the kitchen? You should only be paying for 1/3 of it. And so on.","?

The back of your car will be paid for by the person who hits the back.  That's the default situation.  Everyone loses their no claims' bonus.  

But that can change if there is CCTV or dash cam footage.  It can also change if damage levels are significantly different.  It happened to me. I stopped and was hit from the rear.  The impact pushed the back bumper in front of the rear axle, and pushed me into the car in front of me.  I was able to show my innocence because the front end damage was small.  But it was something I had to fight for.","In the case of a multi-car pileup, the insurance companies involved will typically investigate the accident to determine fault. They will look for evidence such as skid marks, witness statements, and any other relevant information that will help them determine who was at fault. The insurance companies involved will then negotiate between themselves to determine who is liable and who should be compensated. Generally, the insurer of the vehicle found to be at fault will pay for the damages of all the other vehicles involved. In some cases, it may be necessary to involve a third-party mediator to ensure that all parties are fairly compensated."

Like, instead of studying interesting things, traveling interesting places, learning instruments or other skills/talents, they just say ""well look, I'm in a relationship, so that's what I 'do' in my life.""

Since that is the case, it's very hard for them to be alone.

So many of them would rather be in a shitty relationship than single.

Which is very sad.","People put so much of themselves into relationships because they want to feel connected and loved. When people invest in a relationship, they are investing in a bond that can provide them with companionship, support, and joy. They also want to feel secure in the relationship, knowing that the other person is there for them and will be there for them in times of need."

I have far more faith that we will die from the stupidity of mankind rather than the malice of mankind.","In 50 years, the world will likely still be struggling with the effects of nuclear bombs.

In 500 years, nuclear bombs may no longer be a major threat. Nations may have come together to create a global nuclear disarmament agreement that would ensure that nuclear weapons are never used again.

358,"If humans and chimpanzees share 99% of their DNA with one another, then why do human siblings share only 50%? What's going on here?",When we say that siblings share 50% of their DNA we do not count the DNA that is similar among all humans.,"Humans and chimpanzees share 99% of their DNA because they are both members of the same species, Homo sapiens, and share a common ancestor. However, siblings only share 50% of their DNA because each sibling inherits half of their genetic material from each parent, meaning that siblings only share half of their genetic material. This means that siblings may share some of the same DNA, but not all of it."

360,Coffee and alcohol,"As in I'll have two separate beverages? No, never with coffee. I've had water and soda on the side on occasion when I've had straight liquor, beer or even a mixed drink.

Wait, no, I just recalled that I would sometimes get a coffee at brunch and then a cocktail and I would sometimes go from one to the other","Coffee and alcohol can be consumed together, but it is important to be aware of the potential risks associated with the combination. The caffeine in coffee can increase the effects of alcohol, making it easier to become intoxicated, and the diuretic effects of both substances can lead to dehydration. Additionally, drinking too much alcohol can increase the risk of developing certain health problems, including liver disease and cancer. Therefore, it is important to drink responsibly and to be aware of the potential risks associated with consuming coffee and alcohol together."

362,Do you think society needs to believe in redemption to give an incentive to bad people to improve their behavior?,"Redemption can be a double edged sword. Without it, there is no point to becoming a better person after you do something wrong. But it can lead to a “ask forgiveness not permission” mentality. Balance and sincere regret are important to make redemption work.","Yes, society needs to believe in redemption in order to provide an incentive for bad people to improve their behavior. The idea of redemption can be a powerful motivator, as it gives people hope that they can change and be given a second chance. This can help to encourage people to take responsibility for their actions and make positive changes in their lives."
363,"What makes the trolley problem ""thought provoking""? Is killing the one person on the other side not the lesser of two evils, thus the obvious choice?",That's only half the equation. The other half revolves around the question of whether the immorality of actively and willfully taking an innocent life outweighs the good of saving a life.,"The trolley problem is thought provoking because it presents a moral dilemma that is not easily resolved. It forces people to consider the consequences of their actions, and whether or not they would be willing to take responsibility for them. The dilemma presented by the trolley problem is not always a clear-cut choice between two evils; instead, it forces people to consider the ethical implications of their decisions. The “lesser of two evils” is not always obvious, and the trolley problem can be a valuable tool for exploring ethical and moral issues."
364,"Since flowing water has considerable kinetic energy, is it possible for rivers to have uphill sections?","yes.  whenever the water changes from fast to slow, the water will flow ""up hill"" even if the land is flat.  is often looks like a standings wave in the river.","Yes, rivers can have uphill sections. This is possible due to the phenomenon of river capture, in which the water of one river is diverted into another river, creating a new channel. In this process, the river can flow uphill due to the momentum of the water. This process is often seen in mountainous areas where rivers can be diverted by geological uplift or erosion."

Gave up all that garbage at 14.","No, there is no evidence to support the old saying that the best way to make an atheist is to send your daughter to Catholic school. In fact, studies have found that attending a Catholic school does not necessarily lead to atheism. Instead, the results indicate that attending a Catholic school is associated with higher levels of religiosity, rather than lower levels of religiosity."
367,Balanced meal?,"I’m assuming you want healthy suggestions.  Not every meal has to be entirely balanced

Breakfast: eggs/bacon/toast, fruit smoothies, oatmeal

Lunch: a sandwich or wraps with a protein and some veggies with some kind of dressing that you like, salads which you can meat or cheese to it to make it more filling, if you’ve got a microwave then burritos are a good one.  Lunch can also be leftovers from dinner the night before

Dinner: there are so many options but basically you’re looking for a protein, veggies and a carb (which is not necessary but tasty) Here’s some examples:

Chili (which you can add veggies to, and beans).  Biscuits are tasty with chili.

Spaghetti (veggies in the sauce), side Caesar salad and garlic bread

A roast beef or chicken dinner with roasted veggies and potatoes (so many options here; mashed, roasted, scalloped…).  Whenever I make a roast, the leftovers the next day are used for beef dip sandwiches.

Chicken or beef fajitas with peppers and onions

There are loads of casserole recipes; one that comes to mind is chicken, cheddar and broccoli with rice

Stir fry is healthy and you can throw in any protein and vegetables in a sauce that you like, serve with rice or chow mein noodles

Soups are great and can be served with bread or biscuits.  Some soup ideas are chicken noodle soup, loaded baked potato soup, meatball soup","A balanced meal includes a combination of lean protein, complex carbohydrates, healthy fats, and fiber-rich fruits and vegetables. An example of a balanced meal would be grilled chicken breast, brown rice, steamed broccoli, and a side salad with olive oil and vinegar dressing."

369,Does time really exist?,"Time is an illusion, lunch time doubly so.","Time is a concept that humans have created to measure the passing of events. Some people argue that it is an illusion, as it is not an actual physical entity that can be seen or touched. However, it is an undeniable fact that we experience time in our lives, and it affects us in many ways. Therefore, it can be said that time does exist, but it is a subjective concept that may not have the same meaning for everyone."
370,Why is society designed for only morning people and not night owls?,Because up until about 200 years ago people needed the daylight to work/hunt/farm,"Society is not designed specifically for morning people or night owls; it is designed to accommodate a variety of work and lifestyle preferences. People who prefer to wake up early and go to bed early are often able to find jobs that require them to be at work at a certain time, while those who prefer to stay up late and wake up late can often find jobs that allow them to work later in the day or night. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to find a job and lifestyle that best fits their individual preferences."

373,What are the consequences of making the cost of living more affordable?,A populace that isn't constantly tired and sick from overwork because they can barely make enough to get by is less easy to control.,"The primary consequence of making the cost of living more affordable is that it can help to reduce poverty and inequality. This can be done by increasing the wages of low-income earners, providing tax breaks for those in poverty, and increasing access to public services such as health care and education. Making the cost of living more affordable can also help to stimulate economic growth by allowing people to save more of their income and invest it in businesses and other activities that will create jobs and increase economic activity. Finally, making the cost of living more affordable can help to reduce the burden of debt, allowing people to better manage their finances and improve their quality of life."
374,WW3 chances?,"There's a [threat level clock](https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/current-time/) started by atomic scientists back in the 1940s that gauges various geopolitical events and conditions, it's currently set at 90 seconds to midnight. That's close to as high as it's ever been.

The conflict in Ukraine, global tension between east and west, and roiling polarization within industrialized nations all contribute to the threat. Climate change is also a major stressor, as is the possibility of nuclear terrorism.

Setting nuclear war aside, I don't have the same dire fears of a conflict between the US and China that most Americans seem to have. They are threatening to become the world's leading economy, but unlike the USSR, China's economy is very closely linked with ours. 

I would say the odds of WW3 are much higher than they were in the 1990s up to about 2015, but still lower than the odds from say the 1960s to 1980s.","WW3 is unlikely in the near future. Although there are many geopolitical tensions around the world, there is no clear indication that a full-scale world war is imminent."

376,Why is it so hard to think of words in Wordle?,Adding pressure tends to make things more difficult.,"Wordle can be difficult to use because it requires you to think of words that are relevant to the topic or theme you are trying to convey. Additionally, Wordle does not have a thesaurus feature, so it can be difficult to come up with appropriate words that fit the desired context. Additionally, Wordle does not allow you to create multiple word clouds, so if you want to create a different word cloud with a different set of words, you will need to start from scratch."
377,My uncle is gifting me a car -- am I allowed to drive it across state lines before registering it in my home state?,"The car needs to be legally registered and insured to drive on any public roads.

The only way he is going to not be the Republican nominee in 2024 is if the party pulls some sort of shenanigans to choose a nominee against the primary voters' wishes, or if he drops out for some reason.  He is going to be the nominee, and, with respect, if you are using Jeb Bush in 2016 as an example as to how it might go otherwise, you are not paying attention to how Republican primaries actually work.","Yes, people still care about Donald Trump.

Plus, since a 2010 decision, the FCC may not even be able to enforce that anymore.","Live TV can get away with the crowd saying obscenities because broadcasters can take steps to ensure that any inappropriate language is not heard on air.

Why do you refer to yourself in this manner, friend? You're not a moron, or hopeless. You're just human, you're delving into something new, and it's ok to be nervous about it. This happens to all of us in lots of things in life. 

>People tell me all the time to quit putting so much pressure on myself,

They're right, you put too much pressure on yourself. It's ok to not get it right the first time.

>They tell me that I have plenty of time, but I’m not gonna have plenty of time forever, I refuse to be lonely anymore, I want companionship, I’m not gonna ass around then be left in the dark. I have watched as all of my friends have surpassed me in dating, and now they’re all smarter than me socially. I can’t let this go on anymore, I’m not going to be the guy that’s single at 35 that’s attended several weddings that weren’t his own.

But you do have plenty of time. One thing I can tell you, is that women love a man that loves himself. They absolutely love the confidence that this brings. Forget about your friends, it's not a competition, and I can absolutely guarantee to you that you've surpassed them in other areas too. They probably wish they were at your level in those areas too.

Everyone's story is different, and everyone moves forward in different areas of their life at a different pace. You'll get there too.","Dating can be a great way to get to know someone and explore the possibility of a relationship. However, if you put too much pressure on yourself, it can become overwhelming and stressful. It's important to remember that dating is a process and it's okay to take it slow. You don't have to rush into anything. Instead, take your time and enjoy getting to know someone and discovering if you have a connection."
410,Why do people confuse stereotypes with racism?,"It's a part of racial profiling.

And can be used to excuse racist beliefs and behaviours.

Like the ""stereotype"" that Mexican people will work for really cheap.

Or that black people love chicken.

Do you know who else loves chicken? Fucking everyone, how the hell is it a stereotype that black people love chicken.

Racial profiling.

Another stereotype that's racist. ""Jewish people love money"" do you know who else loves money, fucking, everyone.

But it's negatively attached to the Jewish people via stereotype to justify prejudice.

*Most* stereotypes pertaining to race are in the very least, a little racist.","People confuse stereotypes with racism because they are often used interchangeably or as synonyms, when in reality they are two very different concepts. Stereotypes are generalizations about a group of people based on certain characteristics, while racism is the belief that one race is superior to another. Stereotypes can be used in a negative way, but they are not inherently racist."
411,"I have a tryout with a major sports company in the USA next year, how frequent are gunpoint robberies/home thefts etc in the US?","Gunpoint robbery is pretty much non-existent in the US. 

But we need to choose our words carefully here. Most people in the US will never have to worry about being robbed like that. It's one of the safest countries in the world in that regard.

But it's a big country with lots of people, and well, even with a ""one in a million"" chance there's still that ""one"" in ""one in a million""","This is a difficult question to answer because crime rates vary significantly from state to state, city to city, and even neighborhood to neighborhood. In general, crime rates in the United States have been declining for decades. According to the FBI’s 2018 Crime in the United States report, the national violent crime rate declined by 3.3 percent from 2017 to 2018, and the property crime rate decreased by 6.3 percent. Of course, there are still areas of the country with higher crime rates than others, so it is important to research the specific area you will be visiting before your trip."
412,If everyone was rich,"Rich is relative. Wealth is a calculation of supporting a standard of living over time.

If everyone was rich nobody would be assuming a pseudo-free market.","If everyone was rich, the world would be a very different place. People would have access to more resources, which could lead to improved quality of life, such as better healthcare, education, and job opportunities. There would be less poverty and inequality, and a more equal distribution of wealth. However, wealth inequality would still exist, as some people would have more resources than others. It is also likely that with increased wealth, people would become more materialistic and consumerism would increase, leading to more environmental problems. Additionally, the cost of living would likely rise, making it difficult for those with lower incomes to keep up."

416,Why does silver hurt werewolves?,Probably the same reason that moving water has been associated with protection against evil. Like how the headless horseman couldn't cross a bridge. Flowing water is a lot more likely to be safe to drink in the absence of a large population nearby. So people thought it had magical protective properties.,"Silver is believed to have a special ability to hurt werewolves because it is a naturally occurring element and has been associated with the supernatural in many cultures. Silver is believed to have the power to weaken or even kill a werewolf because it is a natural element that is associated with the moon, which is the source of the werewolf's power.

The engine has a spark plug, which is like a sparkler that helps start the engine. It also has a fuel pump, which pumps gasoline into the engine so it can run.

I typically start with materials such as podcasts, videos, and books that are tailored to my language level. I also use online resources like Duolingo, Memrise, and LingQ to practice specific skills. I find that it helps to have a variety of materials to use, as each material focuses on different language learning skills. Depending on the language and the skill I want to develop, I may focus more on audio materials to practice listening, or reading materials to practice reading. I also like to practice speaking as much as possible, so I join language exchanges or find native speakers to converse with."

441,"If nobody can actually own a land, only lease from the country for life, how come China and Singapore have such unaffordable housings?",Could you elaborate why you think the opposite should hold true?,"The answer to this question can be found in the way that China and Singapore have structured their housing markets. In both countries, the government has implemented policies that have caused the cost of housing to become unaffordable for many citizens. For example, in China, the government has tightly controlled the supply of land and housing, preventing new construction from adequately meeting the demand of the market. In Singapore, the government has implemented a number of taxes and restrictions on foreign buyers, making it difficult and expensive to purchase property.
