I'm so excited to finally be graduating and starting my career soon. I'm also looking forward to all the new opportunities that come with being a senior. I'm hoping to take advantage of all the internships and job opportunities that come my way. I'm also planning on doing some traveling during my last year of college, so I'm looking forward to that too."
1,"What are you listening to, watching, or reading? - August 30, 2023","I have been reading old murder mysteries from Gutenberg(dot)org.   Books out of copyright, published before 1927 (?).

For those youngsters who think everything revolves around DNA, these books show how their authors thought their fictional detectives would solve crimes without it.  

As an example search for Freeman Wills Crofts, they have four of his books.  For most of these authors Gutenberg only has one or two of their books.","I'm listening to the new album from the band The 1975, watching the latest episode of the sci-fi show ""Stranger Things"" on Netflix, and reading ""The Power of Now"" by Eckhart Tolle."
2,Where is Cleopatra's tomb?,Personally I believe her tomb to be in the now submerged portion of the ancient city. Good write-up.,Cleopatra's tomb has never been found.
3,A Thought About Asha Degree's Disappearance,"Don’t think that people appreciate the damage done in a collision like this. When I was hit off my bike, there was glass, plastic and paint debris in the road for days after. The blood stains I left were still visible on the tarmac two weeks after, even though we had several rainstorms in that time. Any police force looking for a lost child is almost certain to notice the site of a collision, once you’ve realised how to spot them, it’s impossible to not see them as you drive around",The disappearance of Asha Degree is a heartbreaking and mysterious tragedy that continues to remain unsolved. It is a reminder that we must never take our loved ones for granted and always be vigilant and aware of our surroundings. Asha's story should serve as a reminder to us all that we must never give up hope and must continue to search for the truth.
4,Who killed Rachel Runyan in late August 1982?,"The graffiti was dipshit kids trolling adults and getting them wound up over ""SATAN!!"". I grew up in this area and teens left this type of graffiti around for years afterward. It was pretty traumatic for the community, Halloween that year was basically cancelled, kids were scared to go anywhere, GenXers that grew up there had real lasting damage from it. I think it was someone either local or attached to Hill Air Force Base. The area she was found was sort of out of the way (now a beautiful 4 lane scenic byway), mainly locals used it to get to a reservoir, a ski area, and hunting areas. The playground was not really visible from the road, it was set behind the school with houses on either side and a canal then fence and trees and a 4 lane highway on the east side (google map Doxey Elementary, Sunset UT). It hasnt changed too much in 30 years.
Local police were completely unprepared for that type of crime and did a terrible job. A year or so ago there were some new stories and info from her brother but nothing ever came of it. I felt terrible for her mother, she was just hollowed out by the trauma.",The murderer of Rachel Runyan was never identified. The case remains unsolved.
5,The Essex Boys massacre; did the 1995 overdose death of 18 year old Leah Betts lead to the murder of kingpin Tony Tucker and his criminal associates?,"Great detailed right up OP !

I have to echo the previous comment and feel her father indirectly involved had something to do with the Essex Boys incident.","No, the 1995 overdose death of 18 year old Leah Betts did not lead to the murder of kingpin Tony Tucker and his criminal associates, known as the Essex Boys Massacre. The Essex Boys Massacre occurred in December 1995, nearly six months after Leah Betts' overdose death. The Essex Boys Massacre was the result of an ongoing feud between two rival gangs in the Essex area, which had been building for several months prior to the killings."
6,"Spokane County [Washington] John Doe (1971) identified as Bruce Frank Sherman of Deer River, Minnesota","I’m glad he got his name back. Amazing that he was tattooed with his own initials and never got matched up. Sounds like his family was looking for him, too. So unfortunate he went this long without being identified.","John Doe (1971) was identified as Bruce Frank Sherman of Deer River, Minnesota in January 2021. He had been missing since 1971, when he was last seen in Spokane County, Washington. He was identified using DNA testing and genealogy research. The Spokane County Sheriff’s Office had been working with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to locate Sherman since 1989."
7,Ramsey County [Minnesota] Jane Doe (2000) identified as Gail Marlene Johnson of Minneapolis,"The older clay bust is super accurate! I'm impressed.

[https://www.doenetwork.org/cases/images/270UFMN.jpg](https://www.doenetwork.org/cases/images/270UFMN.jpg)

[https://www.newbrightonmn.gov/ImageRepository/Document?documentId=1751](https://www.newbrightonmn.gov/ImageRepository/Document?documentId=1751)","In April of 2020, Ramsey County Medical Examiner's Office identified the remains of a Jane Doe found in 2000 as Gail Marlene Johnson of Minneapolis, Minnesota. The remains were found in a wooded area near the intersection of Highway 61 and Old Hudson Road in Maplewood, Minnesota. Johnson was identified through DNA analysis and comparison to a family member's DNA profile.

Johnson was reported missing in July of 2000 and her family had been searching for her ever since. Johnson had been living in Minneapolis at the time of her disappearance.

The cause of death remains undetermined and the case remains open. However, the Ramsey County Medical Examiner's Office is continuing to investigate the case with the assistance of the Maplewood Police Department."
8,"Sonoma County [California] John Doe (2014, 2021) identified as Joshua Daniel Fritz of Santa Rosa, California","I'm so glad. It's somehow heartwarming that for once the family of the person was pro active in looking for them, too, and paid attention to does.",", in Sonoma County. Fritz was arrested in 2014 on suspicion of burglary and was sentenced to three years in prison. He was released in 2021."
9,"On October 25, 2017, air traffic control in Northern California detected an unidentified aircraft on radar, which failed to respond to radio communication and did not have a broadcasting transponder. As the aircraft moved north over Oregon, F-15 fighter jets were scrambled to intercept.",The white coloration and unusual design makes me think it was a drone.,"The aircraft eventually identified itself as a private plane and the incident was resolved without incident.

The incident was the result of a miscommunication between the pilot and the air traffic controller. The pilot was on a cross-country flight from Texas to Oregon and failed to properly identify himself to the controller when asked. The controller then issued an alert to the air defense system, which scrambled the F-15s. The pilot was unaware of the alert and was surprised to find the jets on his tail. After the jets identified the aircraft, the incident was resolved without any further action."
10,Ellen Greenberg Suspicious Death in Philly area: Appeals Ct rules against family,"Wow, still labeled as a suicide today. Suicide by self-stabbing is extremely rare, constituting only 1-3% of suicide attempts, with the fatality (‘success’) rate being even lower (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4971271/). I’d wager someone murdered her and got away with it. 

I’m curious if there were defensive wounds, blood under her nails, etc. Why was the husband allowed to fuck with the crime scene? We may have questions we’ll never get the answer to. Sounds like horribly botched, negligent, and maybe even corrupt police work that lead to her killer remaining free.","The family of Ellen Greenberg, a Philadelphia-area woman who died in suspicious circumstances in 2014, has lost its appeal in a wrongful death lawsuit. The case revolved around the death of Greenberg, who was found in her apartment in the Philadelphia suburb of Abington with a gunshot wound to her head.

The Greenberg family had filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the Abington Township police department, alleging that the police had failed to investigate the death properly. The family alleged that the police had not conducted a proper investigation into Greenberg’s death and had not properly followed up on leads.

However, the Pennsylvania Superior Court ruled that the family had failed to provide sufficient evidence of negligence on the part of the police department. The court noted that the police had conducted a thorough investigation into Greenberg’s death, which included interviewing multiple witnesses and canvassing the area.

The court also noted that the police had not found any evidence that would indicate that Greenberg’s death was the result of a criminal act. The court concluded that the family had failed to prove its case, and that the police department had not acted negligently in its investigation of the death."
11,Possible update in the October 2019 Pennsylvania house explosion case! [murder],Thank you for sharing this! I love seeing updates on these cases.,"The October 2019 Pennsylvania house explosion case has recently been updated with the arrest of the homeowner's son, Michael T. McNew, on charges of criminal homicide, arson, and other related offenses. According to police, McNew allegedly set off the explosion in an attempt to kill his father, who lived in the house. The explosion resulted in the death of one neighbor and injured several others. McNew is currently awaiting trial."
12,"Boyd County [Kentucky] John Doe (2020) identified as Zachary Taylor Pearson, originally of Saint Albans, West Virginia",I wonder if Zachary was murdered in West Virginia and taken to Kentucky. It is only about an hour from St. Albans to Ashland.,"At this time, there is no public information available regarding the identity of the John Doe found in Boyd County, Kentucky in 2020. The only information available is that the individual was identified as Zachary Taylor Pearson, originally of Saint Albans, West Virginia. It is unclear what happened to him or why he was in Kentucky."
13,Michigan Murder - 1982 solved using genetic genealogy,"Glad that Kim and Cindy's cases have been solved! 

It sounds like their murderer's family cooperated with law enforcement to bring this closure.","The 1982 murder of 14-year-old April Marie Tinsley in Indiana was solved in 2018 using genetic genealogy. In April 2018, police arrested John D. Miller, 59, of Grabill, Indiana and charged him with murder, child molesting, and criminal confinement. Miller subsequently confessed to the crime. 

The case had been unsolved for 36 years until a genealogist was able to match a DNA sample collected from the crime scene to a distant relative of Miller's on an open-source genealogy website. After analyzing the family tree, police were able to identify Miller as the suspect."
14,"[Obscure Mystery] In 1996, 6 Red Cross workers were assassinated in chechen.","I know that it’s irrelevant here, but for the record, the region is called Chechnya, and the people/language/everything related is Chechen.","The 1996 assassination of six Red Cross workers in Chechnya remains an unsolved mystery. The workers were on their way to deliver aid to a remote village when they were ambushed and killed. The Russian government has never officially identified the perpetrators, although it has been speculated that the attack was carried out by Chechen rebels. The motive for the attack remains unknown."
15,"Three years after 34 year old Diana Ferris was present at the scene of a murder, she and her unborn child were also murdered- beaten and strangled to death in her Connecticut apartment in April of 1996. Who murdered Diana and her unborn child, and was it related to the murder of Thomas Myers?","The circumstances of the murder Diana (almost) witnessed are so bizarre. It seems very unusual for a woman to offer a ride to a guy she doesn’t know, let him stay in the car while she leaves, and not cooperate with the cops when he gets killed _in her car_. Obviously we’ll never know what that was all about since neither of them is alive and could tell the story. Everything about it seems off though.","The murderer of Diana Ferris and her unborn child has not been identified, and it is not known if it was related to the murder of Thomas Myers."
16,"Mother of ""Baby Mary"", murdered newborn found in Mendham Township, New Jersey in 1984, identified and charged","This comment section is going to be a mess, but I'll still go ahead and say that this prosecution is a waste of everyone's time and money. Prosecuting women who were frightened children themselves when they gave birth is not a good use of state resources.",The mother of Baby Mary was identified as 20-year-old Darlene Johnson. Johnson was charged with murder in the first degree and endangering the welfare of a minor in 1985. She was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 30 years and released on parole in 2000.
17,Konark Sun Temple: The abandoned and cursed temple filled with mysteries,That temple looks so beautiful and mysterious. Places like this always have so many secrets about them. It’s so cool and fun to wonder about these.,"Konark Sun Temple is an ancient Hindu temple located in Konark, Odisha, India. It was built by King Narasimhadeva I of the Eastern Ganga Dynasty in the 13th century. The temple is dedicated to the Hindu god Surya, the sun god. It is renowned for its intricate architecture and carvings, depicting stories from Hindu mythology.

The temple is believed to be cursed and has been abandoned for centuries. According to legend, the temple was built by a powerful king who had the power to control the sun. He used this power to make the sun rise and set at his command. However, this angered the Sun God and he cursed the temple to be destroyed. 

The temple is now in ruins and has become a popular tourist destination. Many visitors come to marvel at the intricate carvings and sculptures, as well as the mystery surrounding the temple. Some believe that the temple is home to strange forces and unexplainable phenomena.

Konark Sun Temple is a great example of India’s rich cultural heritage and is a must-visit for anyone interested in exploring the mysteries of this ancient temple."
18,"What happened to Sarah Spiers on January 27, 1996?","I appreciate the write-up, but this isn't TikTok. You don't have to censor ""murder"" and ""deaths.""","Sarah Spiers went missing on January 27, 1996 in the early hours of the morning after attending a party in Claremont, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia. Her body has never been found, and her disappearance remains unsolved."
19,"Missing couple from China went missing in Columbia, Missouri. They went missing days apart and no updates have been made 23 years later. Xiang Sun, Yinzhou Zheng.",I wonder if they obtained new identities and stayed either in the US or moved on to Canada?,"On August 24th, 1997, Xiang Sun and Yinzhou Zheng, a couple from China, went missing in Columbia, Missouri. They were last seen leaving a restaurant in the area. Despite extensive searches and investigations, there have been no updates on their whereabouts for the past 23 years."
20,Who Killed Carol Rofstad?,"Illinois Wesleyan graduate here, thanks for posting about this case! I had never heard of this case before, Bloomington Normal has a couple other murder mysteries that always seemed to get more attention, such as Jennifer Lockmiller and the Hendricks family.  

Before I binge the podcast you link though, I just gotta say a professor using a murder weapon to teach sounds incredibly illegal and something a defense lawyer could easily latch onto.","The identity of Carol Rofstad's killer is unknown. Her body was discovered in a ditch near her home in Snohomish County, Washington in 1988. Despite an extensive investigation, her murder remains unsolved."
21,Broadway Street Phoenix Jane Doe Identified As Missing Mexican Woman,Poor lady. I hope her surviving family obtains some amount of peace from this.,"Phoenix police have identified a body found on Broadway Street as that of a missing Mexican woman.

The body was found on Sunday night in an alley near Broadway Street and McDowell Road. Police said the woman had been reported missing in Mexico and had been identified as 21-year-old Jane Doe.

No further details about her identity have been released.

Police said the cause of death is still under investigation and that they are working with the Mexican consulate to notify her family."
22,Major Update in the Nancy Eagleson Unsolved Homicide - Suspect is Named,"My god, after reading that article that deputy Clair Paulus was a tremendous piece of shit. May he burn in hell.","On June 22, 2020, the Los Angeles Police Department announced the arrest of suspect, Nathan Alfredo Aguilar, in connection with the unsolved homicide of Nancy Eagleson. Aguilar, who is from Los Angeles, was arrested without incident and is being held in the Los Angeles County Jail.

Eagleson, a beloved mother and grandmother, was found dead in her home in the Los Angeles area on December 7, 2018. She was found with multiple stab wounds and her death was ruled a homicide.

The Los Angeles Police Department has been actively investigating this case since the time of Eagleson's death and had been searching for a suspect for more than two years. With the help of new evidence and advanced technology, detectives were able to identify Aguilar as the suspect.

The police are continuing to investigate the case and ask anyone with information to contact them.

This update in the Nancy Eagleson unsolved homicide is a relief to her family and friends, who have been searching for answers for more than two years. The arrest of Aguilar brings a sense of closure and justice to those affected by this tragedy."
23,Non-Existent 'Last Chance Cabin',"Thanks for sharing, I find mysteries like this really interesting.

If I had to hazard a guess, this is what might have happened:

- Some early settler during westward expansion (or someone who came later but is transient, like a trapper etc) makes a camp or winter cabin there
- it ends up being known in the area as Last Chance Cabin. maybe at one point it was the last shelter for X miles if you're following the Pass Creek Pass to the west or whatever.
- when maps are made of the area, it either ends up on the map as a known local point of interest, or is added later as a known location. the adjacent creek is named after the cabin, either because it wasn't mapped before or just didn't have a name.
- some time later, settler or trapper moves on, leaving the cabin abandoned. the building remains and is a known landmark. OR, the settler or locals dismantles the cabin to re-use the lumber, but the cabin's location remains on maps and as a known landmark to locals.
- Colville National Forest is established in 1907. Last Chance Cabin is still a known landmark in the area, or at least appears on available maps, so it's included in maps produced by the forestry service and in lists of known points.
- if it wasn't already dismantled, I'd imagine that the forestry service would have razed or dismantled the abandoned cabin at some point after the forest is established. maybe they reused the lumber for fencing or makeshift bridges, or the clearing as a camp or staging area while they cleared Development Road 400 (right next to the point on the map). it wouldn't be hard for time and heavy use of the site to erase any remaining traces of the cabin. especially considering it's over 100 years since the forest was established, and especially-especially if there was any effort taken to restore the site to nature after use.
- Either nobody at the forestry service realizes that there is no more last chance cabin, OR Last Chance Cabin ends up used as a way to reference ""that clearing we stage equipment in off of Road 400"", so it is not removed from the map.
- now we're at the present day - the existence of Last Chance Cabin has percolated through public data published by the forestry service into a ton of different GIS databases and maps, which are then scraped and re-used by a thousand other maps and websites, which then get scraped... etc. None of these sources care or realize that there is no cabin at Last Chance Cabin.

Do you have any pictures of the site? Even if the cabin is entirely gone and has left no trace I'd imagine there would be evidence of a clearing - no trees, or noticeably younger trees, etc.","The phrase ""Last Chance Cabin"" does not refer to any specific location or cabin. It is a phrase that is often used metaphorically to describe a situation in which one must make a final effort to succeed or avoid a bad outcome."
24,"Man Confessed To ""Brutal, Ice-Blooded Murder' More Than 40 Years Ago In Boston","He's 68 years old. I'm thinking this is less of an attack of conscience and more likely that he was sitting on this to use as a retirement plan. If he can't afford to live out the rest of his days, might as well cash in those 3 hots and a cot for the rest of his life.","In 1977, a man named Kenneth O'Brien confessed to a brutal, ice-blooded murder in Boston. According to police reports, O'Brien had killed a woman and her elderly mother in cold blood. He had entered their home, stabbed them both to death and then set their house on fire. O'Brien was arrested shortly after and confessed to the crime. He was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison. He died in prison in 2017."
25,"Fulton County John Doe Identified, Unclaimed","I would like to know what the story is behind the fact that they first discarded the name and that in the end it was the real one. Could it be a homonym? The father? Why did he have that information with him? Was it a suicide? Or did someone want them to find him? Despite the investigation, it remains a real mystery.","Remains Buried

On April 17th, 2021, Fulton County, Georgia, identified the remains of a John Doe who had been buried in an unmarked grave since 1979. The remains were identified using DNA technology and were determined to be those of John ""Jack"" Strickland, who had been reported missing in 1977.

The identification was made possible by the work of the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, and the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs). After the remains were identified, the county arranged for a funeral service and burial in a marked grave.

The case of John Doe had been cold since 1979, when the remains were discovered in an area of Fulton County. The remains were buried in an unmarked grave in the area, and there were no clues as to the identity of the person. In 2019, the case was reopened and the remains were sent to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation for DNA testing. The DNA results were then compared to the national database and a match was made to the missing person, John ""Jack"" Strickland.

The Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, and the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System all worked together to give closure to the Strickland family. The family was able to put Jack to rest after 43 years.

The case of John Strickland is a reminder of the importance of DNA testing in missing persons cases. It is also a reminder of the importance of agencies working together to provide closure to families who are still looking for their lost loved ones."

30,The family that never arrived to San Angelo. Oldest mass murder in Texas not solved.,"Texas Rangers Cold Case Investigation Details

  Arellano Family

REFERENCE NUMBER: 256 - Unsolved
COMPANY: D
RACE: Hispanic
SEX: Unknown
CITY:
COUNTY: Edwards
RELATED YEAR: 1968

DETAILS:

On April 16, 1968, the Arellano family (Juan, 29; Monica, 24; Rosa, 21; Eduardo, 1; Leticia, 2; and Manuel Jr., 5) were traveling from Mexico to San Angelo, Texas to meet with family members. Their car broke down, with a flat tire. Sometime after that, five (5) members of the family were murdered in rural Edwards County, south of Sonora, Texas. Their bodies were located near Highway U.S. 277. The victims had been shot, stabbed, beaten and Rosa had been sexually assaulted. Leticia died at the hospital two days later. The sole survivor of the incident was Manuel Arellano Jr. Over the years, multiple leads have been followed without success. This case remains one of the most heinous, unsolved, mass murders in Texas. As of this time, no pictures of the family are available. The victims were traveling in a white over blue, 1958 Buick, as seen in this photograph.

According to a Standard-Times report from April 18, 1968, a massive manhunt was organized right away. The hunt for an unknown killer was underway in the sparsely-set countryside north of Del Rio, following the discovery of four victims of an apparent mass murder. The ghastly crime scenes were difficult to sort out, even for experienced officers. In the days following the deaths, more information was released by officials, who called the slayings “a sadistic bloodbath.” Babies were stabbed and beaten, a teenage girl stripped naked, apparently raped and then killed – and a helpless mother and father either bludgeoned, shot or stabbed to death. No apparent death weapon has been found by law officers 2.

Pete Gomez Sr., who in 1968 was working for the Highway Department on a project to widen the road where the murders took place, has erected a memorial marker on U.S. Highway 277 about 34 miles south of Sonora to honor the victims of this unsolved killing spree 2.","The November 22, 1959 murders of the Walker family is considered the oldest unsolved mass murder in Texas. The five members of the family – Eloise, her husband, Paul, and their three children, Deborah, Lindy, and Mark – were headed to San Angelo, Texas for Thanksgiving when they disappeared. Their car was found abandoned in a remote area of Oklahoma, but the family was never seen again. The case remains unsolved to this day and has been featured on television shows such as Unsolved Mysteries and Cold Case Files."

Amber's mom, Donna, worked so hard for all children by creating the Amber Alert. 

I hope that one day Amber's murderer is found and there is justice for Amber!",". To commemorate her tragic story, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children has declared January 13th as National Amber Alert Day in her honor. This day serves to remind people of the importance of Amber Alerts and to continue to spread awareness about the dangers of child abduction. 

Amber Alerts are a vital tool in helping to find missing children. They are broadcasted through radio, television, and other media outlets to quickly spread the word about a missing child. Amber Alerts are activated when a child is believed to have been abducted and is in imminent danger. The more people that are aware of the situation, the better the chances of locating the child. 

On National Amber Alert Day, people are encouraged to take a few moments to learn more about Amber Alerts and what they can do to help. This includes making sure that you are signed up to receive Amber Alerts in your area, sharing information about Amber Alerts on your social media accounts, and talking to your family and friends about the importance of the program. 

By taking part in National Amber Alert Day, we can honor Amber Hagerman and ensure that her memory continues to live on. Let's work together to spread awareness and help bring missing children home safely."

35,"William Oberkiser, American Missing in Newfoundland, October 2011","The local media reported that his destination was a hunting camp near Buchans. 

For those unfamiliar with the area, Newfoundland is a big island, with one highway running the length of it. The island is accessible by ferry at its southwestern point, and the road runs north then east. Buchans is a small and remote inland town which is accessible by highway from the central part of the island of Newfoundland. To get there from the ferry crossing, you have to drive almost a hairpin shaped route that’s about six hours. 

I tested Google Maps the other day [for directions from Stephenville on Newfoundlands west coast, to Buchans](https://imgur.io/a/WF9IZRG) and to my surprise it suggests two routes. Even though there’s only one actual road to get there. The secondary route Google recommended isn’t a road at all. It’s probably an old logging road or something, but it definitely isn’t a maintained route. From the sounds of the news article, the secondary route is where he turned off, and he made it an impressive distance along a road that isn’t a road until his truck could go no further. Unfortunately there’s nothing around that area, no settlements, and no reason why anyone else would be there. It’s truly the middle of nowhere. He probably tried walking in search of help and died lost in the wilderness. 

As to why he wound up there, my guess is that GPS made this seem like a shorter and viable route, and he followed it longer than common sense would have indicated.","William Oberkiser was an American citizen who went missing in Newfoundland in October 2011 while on a hiking trip. He was last seen at the top of Gros Morne Mountain on October 5th. A search was conducted, but no trace of Oberkiser was ever found. He was declared legally dead in 2014."

44,The Westhall encounter Australia's own Ariel school incident.,"Just to play devil's advocate, here is a skeptic's look at the case. According to Dunning, the stories grew and became more embellished as time went on, and if we go by the reported accounts at the time of the sighting there seem to be more prosaic and plausible explanations for this event, rather than a flying saucer: [https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4208](https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4208)

What do you think?","The Ariel School incident occurred on September 16, 1994, in Ruwa, Zimbabwe, when a large number of schoolchildren reported seeing as many as 500 UFOs. The incident attracted international attention and was the subject of an extensive investigation by the Zimbabwean government. Eyewitness accounts from the children indicated that some of the objects were as large as a house and were hovering above the school grounds. Some of the children reported seeing humanoid figures within the objects. The incident is still unexplained, and no physical evidence was ever found."
45,"In 1961, a Massachusetts housewife and mother of two disappeared with a trail of blood leading from her house. What happened to Joan Risch?","There are three main theories I would like to present, though this is not an exhaustive list and anyone is welcome to take a stab at what happened. My top three theories are:

1. Joan staged her disappearance. Her accomplice was likely an affair partner who was driving the mystery vehicle. This theory is best supported by Joan’s library history. It was also found that Joan’s parents died in a mysterious fire when she was young, and that Joan may have been a victim of childhood sexual abuse. Investigators thought was suspicious and may have motivated her to stage her disappearance if she were unhappy. It is also possible that her affair partner* murdered her after a disagreement prior to running away.
2. There was significant construction around Joan’s neighborhood that summer, which brought in many out of town men. It is quite possible that someone staked out the Risch residence and found that her husband was away. This is especially consistent with the milkman’s sighting of the mystery vehicle on the morning of Joan’s disappearance while she was out getting groceries. The police did question three construction workers they thought were suspicious, as well as their manager, but were unable to prove anything. 
3. Finally, what I personally believe to be the most likely theory: Joan was the victim of a botched home abortion. At the time, abortion was illegal and frowned upon. The presence of beer bottles in the trash may have indicated alcohol was used to calm the nerves. The phone ripped off the wall and thrown in the trash while the phone book was open to emergency numbers might indicate that whoever provided Joan with the abortion physically prevented her from calling for assistance for fear of the consequences. Finally, the unconfirmed sightings of Joan are consistent with a woman losing blood from an internal injury and becoming disoriented. Given Joan and her husband’s social standing at the time, she may have been hesitant to ask people in the community (such as her neighbors) for help. It is also possible that the person providing the abortion was Joan’s affair partner*, which would explain the necessity of the abortion as well as why it was botched (as this person probably wasn’t a professional).

*note that mentions of Joan’s affair partner are speculative and unconfirmed","The disappearance of Joan Risch remains unsolved and is one of the most mysterious unsolved cases in Massachusetts. Despite a thorough investigation that included interviews with thousands of people, police found no trace of her. Some theories suggest that she was murdered, possibly by someone she knew, while others believe she was abducted and may still be alive. To this day, the fate of Joan Risch remains unknown."

56,The Mysterious Disappearance of the Roanoke Colony,I've never understood how this is a mystery. They wrote where they were going on a fucking tree.,"The Roanoke Colony, located on the island of Roanoke off the coast of North Carolina, was the first attempt by the English to establish a permanent settlement in the New World. It was founded in 1585 by Sir Walter Raleigh and was home to about 115 English settlers.

In 1590, after several years of difficulty, the colonists suddenly disappeared without a trace. To this day, their fate remains a mystery. There are several theories as to what happened to the colonists, including that they were killed by Native Americans, they assimilated with local tribes, or they relocated to another area.

The most widely accepted theory is that the Roanoke colonists were killed by Native Americans, possibly due to a conflict over resources. This theory has been supported by archaeological evidence, such as the discovery of bones and artifacts belonging to the colonists.

However, there is also evidence to suggest that the colonists may have assimilated with the local tribes and relocated to another area. In 1590, John White, the leader of the Roanoke expedition, returned to the island to find the settlement deserted. He found the word “Croatoan” carved into a tree, which was the name of a nearby Native American tribe. This suggests that the colonists may have assimilated with the local tribes and relocated to another area.

No matter what happened to the Roanoke Colony, its disappearance remains one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in American History."

In recent years, the state of California has taken steps to address the issue of missing children and has created several initiatives to help locate them. In 2018, California passed legislation that requires law enforcement to enter all reports of missing children into the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs). This system allows for cross-jurisdictional searches, making it easier for law enforcement to find missing children and reunite them with their families.

In addition, the California Department of Justice has created the California Missing and Unidentified Persons Clearinghouse, which is a centralized repository for missing persons information. The Clearinghouse allows law enforcement to access a comprehensive database of missing persons and unidentified bodies, and provides resources for families and communities to help find missing persons. 

Finally, the California Attorney General’s office has created the California Missing Children’s Hotline, which is a toll-free number that family members and concerned citizens can call to report a missing child or provide information about a missing child. 

The Lost Children of California are a heartbreaking reminder of the importance of protecting our children and doing all we can to ensure their safety. We must all remain vigilant in our efforts to find these missing children and reunite them with their families."

I remember there's an interview of Allende's widow who claims that when the coup started and after she fled, she found out the presidential house was sacked and she never recovered the personal items there so I'm thinking there's a former soldier who has the pioche on his house","The Piocha de O’Higgins is currently located in the Museo Histórico Nacional in Santiago, Chile. It is a ceremonial sword that was gifted to Bernardo O’Higgins by the people of Chile in 1818. The sword is symbolic of the independence of Chile and is a reminder of the struggles of the Chilean people."

65,BTK Now Suspected in 5 Unsolved Cases,"I wonder if any of the cases he's now suspected in occurred after his last known murder. Maybe he didn't ""retire"" like everyone thought, and he started sending letters as BTK again because he missed the notoriety and fear people had.","BTK (Bind, Torture, Kill) is now suspected in five unsolved cases. The serial killer, who terrorized the Wichita, Kansas area in the 1970s and 80s, has been linked to a string of unsolved homicides, including three in the city of Wichita and two in nearby Valley Center. BTK is believed to have been responsible for the deaths of at least 10 people, including four members of the Otero family in 1974 and four more people between 1977 and 1991. The suspect, who was identified in 2005 as Dennis Rader, was convicted of 10 counts of first-degree murder and is currently serving 10 consecutive life sentences in prison.

In March of this year, the Wichita Police Department announced that they were investigating five additional unsolved homicides that may have been committed by BTK. The cases date back to the 1970s and 80s, and involve the deaths of five people. The victims include a married couple in their 70s, a woman in her 30s, a young woman in her 20s, and an elderly woman. All of the victims were found dead in their homes.

The Wichita Police Department has been working with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies to investigate the possible connections between BTK and the five unsolved cases. They are also looking into whether or not Rader may have been involved in any other unsolved homicides in the area.

At this time, no charges have been filed in connection with these five unsolved homicides. However, the investigation is ongoing and the police are continuing to look for new leads and evidence. It remains to be seen if BTK will be linked to any of these cases, but it is clear that the police are taking them seriously and doing their best to solve them."

72,What’s the strangest theory you have?,"Have to admit i'm a dull skeptic who typically goes for the most likely scenario so mind will likely be uninteresting compared to the more out there theories.

The one that comes to mind is Peter Bergmann was attempting to create a famous mystery like Isdal Woman or Taman Shud with his death. For those who don't know ""Peter Bergmann"" is a John Doe whose body was found on a beach in Ireland. His case is constantly compared to the former two because he went to lengths to hide his identity, giving fake addresses, cutting tags from his clothing, etc. However he was seriously unwell with advanced prostate cancer and other tumours. I think he knew he was dying and he was a mystery buff who was familiar with those cases so he wanted to create his own mysterious death to be remembered. Sadly in that case he was likely a lonely man with little relations or he would figure he would be identified quickly since i'm sure he figured his case would be huge which sadly it isn't really.

I realize there's much more likely scenarios but that's genuinely what i believe in that case until he's identified at least.

He was reported missing by his family the following day. 

A search was launched for the missing student and a number of theories were put forward as to what may have happened to him. Some suggested that he may have been kidnapped or was the victim of a crime, while others thought that he may have left voluntarily. 

The police have conducted an extensive investigation into Mateusz's disappearance but have yet to make any progress in finding him. They have questioned several people who were at the party and have searched the area where he was last seen, but no clues have been found.

Mateusz's disappearance has been widely covered by the media in Poland and the story has also been shared around the world. It has become a symbol of hope for those who are searching for missing people and his family and friends continue to hold out hope that he will be found safe and sound."

The CDC also concluded that the Elizabethkingia anophelis bacteria had likely mutated, making it more dangerous than previously thought. The CDC issued a health advisory to healthcare providers, warning them to be vigilant in monitoring for potential infections of this bacteria.

Although convictions were quashed and compensation was paid relatively early, it wasn't until 2012 that the evidence was reviewed by a fourth coroner, which definitively agreed that Azaria was taken and killed by a dingo.

Barker seems guilty given his past. He always wanted to come across as some guy that the police were out to frame. A neighbor of Cynthia and Heather says that they did see Barker's truck at Cynthia's house on the same day of the murders

However, police have always maintained (from I have read) that the pizza delivery person has never been identified. This is strange, in my opinion. I'm not sure how the pizza delivery person could go unidentified.

Cynthia and Heather were found dead in their home on October 2, 1994. Their bodies had multiple stab wounds and there were signs of a struggle inside the home. Police believe that the killer had broken into the home and attacked the mother and daughter.

The police have investigated the case for years but have not been able to identify any suspects. They have collected evidence from the scene, interviewed neighbors, and searched for clues. However, the case has not progressed and remains unsolved.

The Johnson family has been searching for justice for over two decades and still hopes that one day the killer will be brought to justice. They have put up billboards around the town, held press conferences, and even created a website to help find leads in the case.

The disappearances occurred in the early morning hours of December 7, 1985 in the small town of Ocala, Florida. The two women had attended a movie theater the night before and were never seen again. The investigation into the disappearances remains open and unsolved to this day."

96,"Twin brothers sentenced for their part in the death and cover up of 63-year-old cyclist Tony Parsons in the Scottish Highlands, and new information on how they were caught",I am stunned at the way they treated this witness. She took enormous risks to herself to gather this evidence and they ARRESTED her??,"In August of 2020, twin brothers Robert and David Graham were sentenced to seven and a half years in prison for their part in the death of 63-year-old cyclist Tony Parsons in the Scottish Highlands. The Grahams had been driving a car in the early hours of October 28, 2018, when they hit Parsons, who was cycling on a single-track road. Instead of stopping to help, the brothers drove away and attempted to cover up their crime.

The brothers were eventually caught thanks to a combination of CCTV footage, DNA evidence, and an anonymous tip-off. CCTV footage captured the brothers’ car in the area at the time of the incident, and analysis of the car revealed traces of blood and hair that matched Parsons’ DNA. The anonymous tip-off was then used to identify the brothers as the drivers of the car.

The brothers were found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving and attempting to pervert the course of justice in July 2020. In addition to their seven and a half year prison sentences, they were also disqualified from driving for five years."
97,New York Times: BTK killer named as prime suspect in two unsolved murders,"Once again, his ego is his downfall, there was no reason to provide that specific detail except to gloat and feel superior bc he knows something they don't","The BTK killer, Dennis Rader, has been named as a prime suspect in two unsolved murders that occurred in the Wichita, Kansas area in the 1970s. The victims, 28-year-old Kathryn Bright and 24-year-old Kevin Bright, were both shot to death in their home in 1974. The case went cold until Rader was arrested in 2005 for the BTK killings, which occurred between 1974 and 1991. 

Rader has not been charged with the Bright murders, but investigators say they have strong evidence that he was involved. DNA evidence from the crime scene was recently tested and a match was found with Rader’s DNA. Additionally, investigators have found numerous similarities between the Bright murders and other BTK killings. 

Rader has not yet responded to the allegations, but investigators are hopeful that he will cooperate in order to provide closure to the Bright family. The Bright family has been waiting for justice for more than four decades, and they are hoping that Rader will finally be held accountable for the deaths of their loved ones."
98,"Skeletal remains found in Redding, CA identified as man missing for over 11 years",He was found less than 2 miles from his last known location,"Skeletal remains found in Redding, CA were recently identified as those of a man who had been missing for over 11 years. The remains were identified as those of Steven D. Smith, who was last seen in April 2009. Smith had been reported missing by his family after he failed to return home from a fishing trip.

The remains were discovered in January 2021 by a hiker in the Whiskeytown National Recreation Area. After a forensic analysis of the remains, the Shasta County Sheriff's Office was able to identify them as those of Smith.

The cause of death has not yet been determined, but authorities are continuing to investigate. Smith's family is relieved to have closure after so many years of not knowing what happened to him."
99,"On April 23, 2007, pilot Ray Bowyer and his passengers discovered a bizarre yellow-lit, mile-long aircraft over the English Channel. Air traffic control received other reports, and picked up something strange on ground radar.","I had never heard of this sighting before! I have been enjoying the UFO posts lately, thanks OP!","The aircraft was huge and had no wings, yet it seemed to move silently and at a very high speed. It was described as being cigar-shaped and yellow in color. It left no exhaust trail, and the object was too large to be an aircraft.

The Ministry of Defense could not explain the UFO sighting, and it remains a mystery to this day. Some people believe it could have been a secret military craft or an alien spaceship, while others believe it was a natural phenomenon. Whatever it was, it has never been seen again."

What are they doing in Solano County?",The survey questions are super interesting to me- they’re gauging how their project will be received based on the development group. The idea of a whole-ass city it pretty wild though. I’m very curious to see where this goes.,"Flannery Associates is a real estate investment firm based in San Francisco that focuses on acquiring and developing large-scale properties. They recently purchased 52,000 acres around the Bay Area Air Force base for $1B. It is unclear what their plans are for the land, but speculation is that they may be looking to develop residential and commercial properties or to use the land for recreational purposes. It is also possible that they are looking to expand the Air Force base, as the land is adjacent to it."
101,Grand Bay Jane Doe Identified Through DNA Despite Prior Cremation,Oh wow! I’m glad Ada has her name back and also hopeful they will do more to investigate what happened to her. It sounds like a horrible crime was committed against her while she was trying to enjoy her favorite pastime by herself. That’s awful!,"In 2019, the remains of a woman found in Grand Bay, Alabama in 1978 were identified through DNA testing as 23-year-old Linda Ann Laughlin. The woman's remains had been cremated prior to the testing, making identification more difficult. The investigation was reopened in 2017 after a family member of Laughlin's had submitted a DNA sample to the DNA Doe Project, a non-profit organization that uses genetic genealogy to identify the remains of unidentified persons. After the DNA sample was submitted, a match was found with a missing persons report from California in 1978. This report was then used to identify the remains as Laughlin's. 

Laughlin had left her home in California in 1978 and was never seen again until her remains were discovered in Grand Bay. The cause of her death remains unknown. 

The case was solved through a combination of DNA testing and genetic genealogy. DNA testing allowed for a match to be made with the missing persons report, while genetic genealogy allowed for a family member to be identified who could then provide a DNA sample. This case serves as an example of the power of DNA technology and genetic genealogy in helping to identify missing persons and solve cold cases."
102,A mother and her son left home to do an early morning exercise. One week later they would both be found murdered with the mother beaten and raped and the having been hanged alive from a tree.,This really struck me. So brutal. Thank you for doing this write-up and bringing it to my awareness.,This is an incredibly tragic and horrifying story. It is difficult to imagine the pain and suffering that the mother and son must have endured in their last moments. It is important to remember that violence and crime of any kind should never be tolerated and those responsible for such horrific acts should be brought to justice.
103,"On August 24, 2000, 15 year old Yu Man Hon, who had autism, intellectual disability and ADHD, disappears from Hong Kong and ends up in Shenzhen. 23 years later, his whereabouts are unknown.",Why is there a picture of a women on the id?,"In the months after Yu Man Hon's disappearance, his family worked tirelessly to locate him. They reported his disappearance to the police and distributed fliers with his photo. They searched shelters and even hired a private detective to try to locate him. The police also conducted searches in both Hong Kong and Shenzhen, but despite their efforts, Yu Man Hon's whereabouts remain unknown.

It is possible that Yu Man Hon may have been taken advantage of by someone and is now living on the streets or in a shelter. It is also possible that he may have been able to find some sort of employment and is living an independent life. It is even possible that he is no longer alive. Without any new leads or information, it is impossible to know what happened to Yu Man Hon.

The case of Yu Man Hon highlights the lack of services and support available for people with disabilities in Hong Kong and the need for better protection for vulnerable people. It also serves as a reminder that missing persons cases can remain unsolved for years, and the families of missing persons often face a long and difficult journey in their search for answers."

107,The found but lost children of California Post 8.,"The last one is very strange. First thought is that someone kept a bunch of their baby teeth as they fell out and then decided ""to hell with this, teeth are gross"" and just tossed them out somewhere. If you think about it, it's surprising we don't all find random baby teeth all the time, since everyone has like 20 to lose in childhood. Hopefully it's just someone who tossed their old baby teeth and is still happily moving along through life today.","Unfortunately, there is no way to answer this question definitively without more information. It is possible that the California Post 8 is a reference to a specific military organization or post, or it could refer to a newspaper or magazine. If the reference is to a military organization, it is possible that there is a record of the children who were lost, but that record would likely be held by the organization itself. If the reference is to a newspaper or magazine, it is possible that the children were mentioned in an article, but it would be difficult to track down the article without knowing the specific publication and issue."
108,(Request) Cases in which the only mystery is where the body is located?,"First one that comes to mind is [Kristin Smart](https://charleyproject.org/case/kristin-denise-smart). She was a Cal Poly student who went missing after a party in 1996. She was last seen with another student that she’d met at the party, Paul Flores. Flores told others that he would help Smart, who was intoxicated, back to her residence. Flores said he just continued on to his residence and never saw her again, but no one bought it. He apparently had a reputation for being sexually aggressive towards women. In 2021 he was arrested for her murder and his father was arrested for accessory after the fact. Police believed that he killed Kristin during a rape or attempted rape in his dorm room after the party, and then he took her body to his dad’s house where the dad helped him bury it. When police did a search they found an area under the deck that looked like it had been a shallow grave, cadaver dogs hit on it, and while they couldn’t get any DNA from the soil they did find fibers consistent with clothes Kristin was wearing when she disappeared. The father apparently never went around the area and refused to let plumbers or other workers near it either. Seems the body had been moved fairly recently to when police dug up the area.

Flores was found guilty of Kristin’s murder (his father was acquitted for accessory after the fact) and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. So they know what happened to her, just not where her body is.","1. Missing Persons Cases

109,The Disappearance of the Santiagos,"What a very sad case . Sadly, I don’t think they are alive; it sounds like a murder/ suicide. Those poor little boys.","The disappearance of the Santiagos is a mysterious and unsolved case involving the disappearance of an entire family from a small Spanish town in Galicia, Spain in 1999. The family, consisting of a husband, wife and four young children, was reported missing on June 30th, 1999. Despite multiple searches and investigations, the case remains unsolved and the family has never been found.

The disappearance of the Santiagos has been the subject of numerous articles, books and documentaries, as well as an ongoing investigation by Spanish law enforcement. The case has been linked to a number of theories, including a possible abduction, a family feud or a religious cult. To date, no evidence has been found that would definitively explain the disappearance of the family. The case remains unsolved and the fate of the Santiagos remains a mystery."

It seems he is happy with them.,"On November 6, 2019, the body of a young boy identified as ""Cordarius"" Doe was found in a wooded area in Jackson County, Mississippi. The Jackson County Sheriff's Office has been investigating the case and recently announced that the mother of the child has been arrested and charged with murder.

The mother, whose name has not been released, was taken into custody on November 15. She is currently being held without bond.

The body was discovered by a hunter in the woods near a rural community. It is believed that the boy had been dead for several days before he was found. An autopsy revealed that the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head.

The Jackson County Sheriff's Office has not released any further details about the case, including the identity of the child or the circumstances surrounding his death. However, they did confirm that the investigation is ongoing and they are still working to identify the child.

At this time, the Jackson County Sheriff's Office is asking anyone with information about this case to come forward. They are also asking for the public's help in identifying the child."
111,"Request: Scott Ratigan (Arlington, VA)","I don't think the person is a woman as some of you guys speculate. He looks and runs like an athletic man. The kind that does triathlons not the bulky, gym kind.

Some things I've noticed:

1. He covered the backpack logo with duct tape
2. Zero wear and tear on his clothing (see the bright white of the shoes), meaning he bought a new set of disposable garments for this only
3. White soles shoes: don't leave marks if there is a struggle
4. Dressed to run if needed
5. I feel like the limp was fake, he knew there were cameras and looking for a fake trait is a great diversion.
6. He probably pulverized sodium hypochlorite and/or similar substances on surfaces inside the apartment to destroy possible DNA traces (judging by the smell that lasted until \~5PM when the 911 call was made, the quantity/concentration was significant)
7. Seems he's in complete control **after** the crime. He only seizes the opportunity to run and catch the green light, but doesn't seem distressed, looking behind or generally more aware of his surroundings.
8. I think Scott was expecting someone, but he didn't knew exactly who. Perhaps somebody he trusted or owned a favor to told him to expect a courier or a collector. He took a day off from work to be home at **that specific hour and day**. He had to be **alone,** but his sister was living with him, so this meeting was probably risky during the weekends or evenings. It's very hard to speculate why, but it was most certainly something that he wanted to hide even from family.
9. Some people say he only wanted to have a long weekend (MLK day was Monday), but how would it be possible for the killer to known he was home at that **specific hour and day**, when his regular schedule indicated he should have been working? It was clearly a planned meeting.
10. Considering this, the suspect most probably simply just entered the building and the apartment. No mystery here, Scott let him in. I'm almost certain about that, otherwise too many things wouldn't make sense.

It seems unlikely to be a case of mistaken identity, considering how well premeditated this seems to be. Also, if somebody is willing to pay a professional, the victim must have been in some serious trouble that is not yet disclosed.","Answer: Scott Ratigan is a professional photographer based in Arlington, Virginia.

112,"Who was Wa Sang Siu, aka Martin? Is he dead, or is this a case of stolen identity? And if so, whose identity was stolen by who?",I’m wondering if multiple people (perhaps brothers or close relatives) have intentionally shared the same identity to work in Australia. The original person using the identity returned home and “Martin” continued to work in Australia. This would explain “Martin” having the contact info for his “Brother” and the family knowing who “Martin” really was and accepting his death initially. The later situation can be explained by the surviving family wanting to avoid getting into trouble with authorities over identity/immigration fraud.,"Wa Sang Siu, also known as Martin, was a Chinese-American who lived in San Francisco in the early 20th century. He was a prominent figure in the Chinese-American community and was a leader in the Tong Wars, a series of disputes between rival Chinese gangs in San Francisco. He was also a successful businessman and owned several businesses in the city.

Martin is believed to have died in 1923, although there is some dispute over this. Some accounts suggest that he may have been the victim of a case of stolen identity, with another person assuming his identity. However, there is no evidence to support this claim."
113,"Who killed Carole Ann Kresik of East Pittsburgh, PA in 1986?","The best move would be a reward being offered for information leading to the killer. In some ways 1986 wasn't that long ago for anyone who was grown up in that decade- & it is likely the killer struck again. A tip could turn into a way to identify the killer.

Also a reward in my region for a cold case did end up helping close the case (no one collected on it, but the awareness of the reward kept the case in public conversation.)","The murderer of Carole Ann Kresik of East Pittsburgh, PA in 1986 has never been identified."
114,"Between the mid 70s and early 80s, the headless remains of three unidentified young boys were found on beaches within 25 miles of eachother in California, could these three cases be connected?","It's gruesome, but it's not uncommon for bodies in water to become dismembered during the process of decomposition, esp in actively moving waters like the ocean. As connective tissue decays, the body is exposed to scavenger predation, and the body moves with the waves and tides, it weakens and can fall apart. As I recall, Laci Peterson's body was found headless (although I may be misremembering).

Not saying the cases *aren't* related, or that they're not a result of foul play, of course.","It is possible that the three cases could be connected. However, without further evidence, it is impossible to definitively answer this question. Investigators would need to compare the circumstances of the three cases and look for any similarities in order to determine if the cases are connected."
115,"In the fall of 1930, 16-year-old Alice Woltman was attacked in her family’s South Bend, Indiana home. Despite sharing her bedroom with three siblings, Alice’s killer slit her throat without waking a single person. Sadly her case remains unsolved.","I had a thought that maybe the killer meant to target one of her sisters and killed the wrong sister. I wonder how similar they all looked?  In a dark room at night, with people under covers and siblings sharing beds, it’s possible. 

This won’t ever be solved sadly; too much time has passed and I’m sure any evidence they collected is long gone. Whoever did it really hated Alice (or one of her sisters).

Edited: looked at the pics of the newspaper clippings and wow, the news story about the 107 Fascists elected in Germany to become the second largest political party there  as a small blip accompanying the horrible murder news. Would’ve been passed over as just election news from Europe, nothing to worry about or pay any attention to in America.","At the time of her death, Alice was a student at Central High School, where she was a member of the Latin Club. She had also recently started working as a clerk at the local grocery store. Her parents, who were immigrants from Russia, had come to the United States in search of a better life for their children. 

Alice’s murder quickly became a local sensation. Police searched for her killer but were unable to find any leads. Despite offering a $500 reward, no one came forward with any information. 

Alice’s death left her family and community devastated. Her untimely death, and the lack of resolution, remains a mystery to this day."

This is an excellent write up and you did a great job researching these possible victims of his. Thank you for sharing and getting their names and cases out there, regardless if they are linked to him or not. These older cases all need resolution and this is just one of the ways to make their cases known. I wonder if there is any evidence or anything else left behind that could possibly link him to more crimes now or in the future, since there’s always new advancements and older cases being solved so often these days.","No, Christine Marie Eastin and Robin Graham are not victims of Ted Bundy.

* Nearly 80% of people who die from drowning are male. Many factors might contribute to higher rates of drowning among males, including increased exposure to water, risk-taking behaviors, and alcohol use.

Replace water with crazy cliffs in this scenario.

Also just because you look fine on video doesn't mean you're not shit faced. I've been brownout drunk and people had no idea.

Plenty of families and friends refuse to accept their loved one died while intoxicated. They seem to always point to some nefarious reason they're dead. But why do they often disappear after leaving the bar, instead of say, during the day when sober.

If she was newly in America, I worry that she was isolated and that even if anyone had taken notice of her, they’ve either forgotten or passed away. If she has had children, I wonder if they’re still alive and where they are. Now that I think about it, there’s no guarantee that just because she gave birth, the children were born alive. Ach. 

That she was found wearing all her clothes makes me wonder if it was someone she knew and the motive wasn’t sexual. She even had her poncho on. I know she could have rejected someone and they could have gone right to 100, but I just wonder what her relationship was to the murderer and whether it was someone she knew well versus a stranger or person she met for the first time before her murder. 

I suppose the school and programme she was potentially involved in didn’t keep records going that far back, if it even still exists. What a frustrating case.","Little Miss Lake Panasoffkee is a beauty pageant held annually in Lake Panasoffkee, Florida.

125,"Unsolved murder of Eileen Wafer in Haines, Alaska","Thanks for the writeup!

Some context: Haines is a tiny city in Alaska that had 993 residents in 1980 according to the census. If one of those residents did not commit the murder, the murderer most likely drove into Haines on the [Haines Highway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haines_Highway#Major_intersections), as the incident with the sister and the strange man who wouldn't talk to her might corroborate. Haines Highway is the only road connecting Haines to the rest of the continent's road network. It requires crossing a US-Canadian border, which was way less formal back in the 1980s but nowadays would have a video recording of every car going in and out of the country. Another possibility is that the perpetrator was a fisherman who was not a permanent resident of the city. The manner of death (strangled with fishing twine) stands out to me in support of that.

Most of what Lois Wheeler notes about the case rings true. I do think Eileen was stalked by someone local, maybe even at the motel, who made their move that night after they saw Lois leave. If the perpetrator was not a fisherman, it follows that the fishing twine was chosen in advance and was ready to go. She is also right that the case was not taken as seriously as it should have by the authorities.","On October 1, 1976, the body of Eileen Wafer, a 19-year-old Native Alaskan woman, was found in a remote area near Haines, Alaska. She had been murdered and her body was found partially covered in leaves. Wafer had been seen alive the day before, and had been hitchhiking from Haines to Juneau. 

The case remains unsolved, and no suspect has ever been identified. The FBI investigated the case, but no progress has been made. The case remains open and anyone with information is encouraged to contact the Alaska State Troopers."

127,It has been nearly ten full years since Tiffany Whitton disappeared. What happened to her?,"Esquire did a long write-up on this case too.

https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a44402/missing-tom-junod/","Unfortunately, the mystery of Tiffany Whitton's disappearance remains unsolved. She was last seen on the night of July 15, 2010, in the town of Newberg, Oregon. The investigation into her disappearance has been ongoing for years, but no concrete evidence has been found that would lead to her whereabouts or the identity of her abductor."
128,Is Ryan Widmer guilty of the Bathroom Drowning of his wife. The evidence seemed weak but is it possible for a presumably healthy 24 year old to just drowned in a bathtub without obvious explanation?,"So, I don't want this to come across as accusing or critical of your write-up, but I feel like we should at least consider the facts that were presented to a jury. This kind of makes it sound like the argument was, ""Well, (shrug) what else could it be?"" And I completely, 100% understand the argument that the facts aren't enough to overcome reasonable doubt. I think I lean that way myself. So this comment isn't so much arguing for his guilt; I just want to make sure people understand that they weren't weighing whether or not she fell asleep in the tub.

**He claimed she was face-down in the tub.**

In his initial 911 call, he told them that she ""fell asleep"" and drowned and he ""thought she was dead."" He said he found her face down in the tub, and he had not moved her at the time he called 911. He apparently did not get her out of the tub until asked to do so. This position is not consistent with someone slipping under the water after falling asleep. And - in fact - when his family had reached out to a show after his conviction, their investigator concluded he had lied in his 911 call. Bizarrely, he told this investigator that he had found her face up, initially denying that he'd ever said she was face down. He later admitted that his initial story had her face down, but still claimed she was face up. This is an oddity that is a bit more than an ""inconsistency."" [source](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/crime/crime-and-courts/2018/07/25/new-investigation-ryan-widmer-and-his-wifes-death-hes-not-telling-truth/824852002/)

For another inconsistency, he told 911 that she falls asleep in the tub ""all the time."" After she was declared dead at the hospital, he told a detective that he ""was afraid she may fall asleep in the tub."" When the detective asked if that had ever happened before, he said, ""no, she had never fallen asleep in the tub before, but Sarah would fall asleep easily.""

**Her body was not wet. The tub was not wet. The floor was not wet.**

This is important, because it was noted by multiple people. The EMTs said her body was dry and only her hair was damp. They did not notice any pruning on her fingers. They also did not notice any damage to her fingernails and manicure. Detectives arrived at the scene as the ambulance left. They noted that the tub was not wet. It had a few water droplets around the drain, but it was otherwise dry. The towels were not wet. The floor was not wet. A magazine, a bathmat and discarded clothes lying on the bathroom floor were all dry.

A lot has been made about how her body seemed weirdly dry, and the first conviction was thrown out when it was discovered that some jurors timed how long it took their own bodies to dry after getting out of a bath. They concluded that it was impossible for that to happen in 3 and a half minutes. But this is considered a juror doing independent research, and that's why the first conviction was thrown out. [source](https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/crime--law/widmer-juror-speaks-out-about-trial/T7jiWJjy28YQALEcrRJxqJ/) Yes, this is misconduct, and it was proper that the first conviction was thrown out, but I think it's also helpful for us to understand that ""misconduct"" does not mean they were wrong about the facts. In the source listed in the previous section, a TV show also performed this test, with a woman getting out of a bath and air drying for 8 and a half minutes. She was still wet. He claims he pulled the plug on the bath tub (and didn't try to remove her or anything), and that is why she wasn't as wet. But again, he also claims he called 911 immediately, and he was unable to pick her up because she was too slippery. He also said he drained the tub during the 911 call.

In addition to everything being dry, the TV was on a different channel than the Bengals game, and there were bath products lined up on the edge of the tub. [source](https://casetext.com/case/widmer-v-warden-1)

**She had a head contusion, scalp injuries, petechial hemorrhaging in her eye, cuts to her upper lip, and deep hemorrhaging in her internal neck (and a lot of smaller abrasions and contusions, including in her armpit)**

His defense claims these were caused by CPR and intubation, and medical examiners disagree on whether neck bruising and hemorrhaging could be caused by the efforts to save her. CPR does not typically injure the neck, but they did try to intubate her. The question is whether she was alive when EMTs first arrived, I guess. For what it's worth, Emergency responders noted that she did not have a pulse and she wasn't breathing when they first arrived. He also believed she was dead when he first found her. For the CPR and intubation to cause hemorrhaging, she would still need to have been alive when they arrived. Petechial Hemorrhaging typically occurs when pressure is placed on the neck. On the other side of this, drowning victims have been resuscitated after breathing has stopped. I think this is too advanced for anyone other than medical examiners who have seen her autopsy/autopsy photos to call.

**Blood and fecal matter were found on the bedroom carpet in locations that did not match with where EMT placed her**

This is getting into the weeds a little bit, but the first responders moved her to the bedroom for treatment. \[Edit, correction here, first responders never saw her in the bathroom. Widmer had moved her body to the bedroom before they arrived. The first person on the scene found her lying on the bedroom floor, her body was warm and dry, but her hair was wet. She had no pulse and wasn't breathing. He also did not notice any clear external injuries, though\]. When investigators went back to take samples from the area, there was blood and fecal matter in the area where her head had been laid. Fecal matter was also found in a different area, near where she was laid, but not exactly there. The blood is pretty easy to explain, because first responders also noted frothy blood leaking from her mouth while giving her treatment. Fecal matter is a different story, though. There was no fecal matter found near where her genitals would have been when she received treatment. I'm not sure if this is where the theory came about that he drowned her in the toilet. I gather it wasn't used at his last trial, but I'm only getting that from some of his assertions in his appeal. The other possibility is that a violent event started in the bedroom and then moved to the bathroom. \[edit: Or that she didn't actually die in the bathroom at all, but rather after she had already left the bath.\]

I've not seen what his Defense makes of this piece of evidence.

**He was visiting Adult Friend Finder before her death**

I normally wouldn't mention this, because someone looking at porn is not a motive to kill a spouse. But Adult Friend Finder is not just porn; it is also used to hook up with real people. Luckily, his Defense was successful in prohibiting this from being shown at trial, so the juries were unaware of this. The prosecution couldn't prove that Sarah knew he was trying to hook up with people on the site, so they were not allowed to present it as evidence. I only bring this up because the OP mentions that he was only seeking out other women 2 years after her death. There is evidence to the contrary. But it was correctly prohibited from his trial.

Now, does all of this overcome reasonable doubt? I'm not sure. Again, I didn't write this comment to argue for his guilt, even though it may appear that way. It's more that I wanted a fuller story for how 3 separate juries were unable to arrive at a not-guilty verdict. Even with these facts, I'm not sure I could overcome reasonable doubt in a court of law, though it would be interesting to read the trial transcripts. But a lot of the comments here seem to think this is about whether or not someone can fall asleep and drown in the tub. The juries heard a very different set of facts. It's not so much that they couldn't think of any other explanation. It's that he was ""inconsistent"" on some material, basic facts. The physical evidence didn't match his description of events, and her injuries were more than some light bruising in her neck.","The jury in the Ryan Widmer case found him guilty of the bathroom drowning of his wife. The prosecution presented evidence of prior arguments between the couple, as well as testimony from neighbors who heard a disturbance on the night of her death. The prosecution also presented evidence of inconsistencies in Widmer's story of the events that night.

While it is possible for a seemingly healthy 24 year old to drown in a bathtub without obvious explanation, the jury ultimately found that the evidence presented by the prosecution was sufficient to prove Widmer's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt."

The disappearance of James Anthony Reynolds is one of the most mysterious unsolved cases in modern history. On November 18, 1983, James, then aged 19, was travelling in a car with three friends in the small town of Sylvania, Georgia. The car was stopped by local police for a minor traffic violation, but when the officers asked for identification, James suddenly disappeared without a trace.

Despite exhaustive searches, police have never been able to find any sign of James, and the case remains unsolved to this day. In the years since his disappearance, numerous theories have been put forward as to what happened to James, but none of them have been able to provide a definitive answer.

The disappearance of James Anthony Reynolds is a stark reminder of how quickly and unexpectedly tragedy can strike, and the grief of his family and friends still lingers to this day."

134,"Cheatham County [Tennessee] Jane Doe (1981) identified as Linda Sue Karnes of Cunningham, Tennessee","I was able to see a few previews of archived articles from the Clarksville, TN Leaf-Chronicle, and was able to make out “To a visitor, the Montgomery County Girls Home seems [more like] a college dorm than a home [for run]aways, unruly girls, and the [victims of?] abuse and neglect.” If anyone has a newspapers.com subscription, you’ll be able to read the articles.

She had an older brother named Ricky (may have been only a year older—first reference to him was less than a year before she was born, and he’s referred to as “baby Ricky”). It appears that he ended up living with the Baggett family (I think they’re related—in the great grandmother’s obituary, there were something like 22 grandchildren, 30 great grandchildren, and 12 great great grandchildren, so it was a very large family), while she was with the great grandmother —Elsie.

138,"From ""drunk on the boardwalk"" to dead of a brain injury - who is Brighton Beach John Doe?","So, my hometown has a riverfront park with a small boardwalk and a little trail along the water. Lots of drinking goes on there, teens and homeless people hang out in this park and there have been a few “mysterious” incidents where people have disappeared after hanging out in the area and later been found deceased in the water. 

When I was a teenager, my boyfriend and I were walking around down there having a drink, late at night in the summer. We heard a weird groaning and followed it to find a man lying on the ground absolutely *covered* in blood. He was lucky he hadn’t fallen in the water, he was close. So we go over and try to assess what happened, dude has a huge lump on his head and all his front teeth are busted out. He was really hard to understand and incoherent, but from what we gathered he hadn’t been assaulted, he’d tripped and fallen. I tried to search for any teeth that might be able to be put back in but didn’t find any (not sure if that’s actually possible but I tried lol) I couldn’t tell if he was drunk or just concussed, and his mouth was all fucked up…

He really, really didn’t want an ambulance because he didn’t have insurance, so we called my boyfriend’s mom to drive us to the hospital.

152,The disappearance of Chantal de Montgaillard,"How can someone hear a child crying, at midnight, in a cemetery and not do ANYTHING? It seems like she wandered off from the van and couldn’t find her way back. 

I think she was either preyed upon after she played with those children and couldn’t find her way back or she got lost and succumbed somewhere but I find it strange she wasn’t found. 

Had she have wandered off after playing with those children, someone must have seen her wandering alone (unless the perp caught her very soon after they finished playing), and had she have wandered off and became lost and was still wandering at midnight you would think someone would have seen.","Chantal de Montgaillard, a French woman who disappeared in May 1995, remains missing to this day. She was last seen in the small village of Cournon, in the department of Cantal in the Auvergne region of France. 

At the time of her disappearance, Chantal was 30 years old and was living with her partner and their two children. She was last seen on the morning of May 21, 1995, when she left her home to go to the local post office. She never returned home, and her disappearance has remained a mystery ever since.

Various theories have been proposed as to what may have happened to Chantal, from her being the victim of a crime to her having suffered an accident or simply leaving the area. However, there is no evidence to support any of these theories and Chantal's whereabouts remain unknown.

The case has been the subject of multiple investigations, both by the police and by private investigators, but no trace of Chantal has ever been found. Her disappearance remains one of the most mysterious cases in modern French history."

155,The found but Lost children of California. Post Seven.,Thank you for keeping these babies alive with your post. I hope someday they get their names back.,"The story of the lost children of California is a heartbreaking one. In the early 20th century, many children in California were placed in orphanages and foster homes due to poverty, family disputes, and other issues. The children were often mistreated and neglected, and some were even sold as slaves. While most of these children were eventually reunited with their families, some were never found. 

In the 1990s, a group of volunteers began searching for these lost children. They traveled across the state, interviewing former foster care providers, orphanage administrators, and other people who might have information about the missing children. They also searched through old records and newspapers in an effort to find clues. 

The volunteers’ efforts paid off, and they were able to locate and reunite many of the lost children with their families. Unfortunately, many of them remain missing to this day. The volunteers continue to search for these lost children, hoping that one day they will be able to find them and reunite them with their families."

161,A man last left his workplace on his motorbike but never reached home. What happened to Boo Meng Hock? (Singapore),"The thing about Mr. Boo being diabetic is another factor I was wondering about. If he wasn't accustomed to being out late (whether or not he actually had any drinks), depending on how severe his condition was, if he'd had a sugar low he might have had some trouble while going home. (One of my co-workers has diabetes, and her husband has had to search for her on a couple of occasions ... she always uses the same path and calls home before starting out, and if she's even a few minutes late he starts out in case she's having difficulties.) Someone else has already posted, about whether there might be water along the route -- ponds, canals, etc.  


The other possibility -- that someone at the Turf Club or elsewhere on his way to his workplace heard about Mr. Boo's good fortune, and decided to take advantage -- is more dismaying. They would have had to be patient and lucky though, if they were waiting to ambush him. Even if his route home was predictable. One of his friends/co-workers doing that is also possible (and especially sad.)

Also -- ""However, when the family searched the temple, they found no trace of Ah Hu, Mr Boo or his motorcycle.""   
\-- If Ah Hu was supposedly staying at the temple, I wonder where he was when Mr. Boo's family checked on him?

162,"Who killed Larisa Komsky in Brooklyn on November 15, 2011?","A few points of clarification:

• Larisa Komsky's office was approximately a 5 or 6 minute drive from her home (Google Maps reports the distance as 1.1 miles / 1.77 km)

• In addition to following Larisa Komsky from her business to her home, the attacker hid behind another vehicle while Ms. Komsky parked her car and then ambushed her when she exited the vehicle

• The neighbors reportedly heard Ms. Komsky cry out ""What are you doing here?"" (as opposed to ""What are you doing?"" per the write-up)

A neighbor also reportedly heard Ms. Komsky call her attacker ""you son of a bitch"" (which, fair criticism for someone who has just stabbed you)

It sounds like the attack on Ms. Komsky was a continuation of an earlier conflict or altercation. I wonder if her attacker was escalating a random argument with a stranger-- or if the attacker was an acquaintance or somehow related to/involved with a client of her CPA [Certified Public Accountant] firm. I imagine that law enforcement has looked at potential leads related to her professional life-- I would be curious about whether any of her clients were in high-conflict financial situations (for example: a married couple who are in the process of separation/divorce or a jointly-owned LLC with some accounting anomalies that could point to fraud or embezzlement)

165,Unidentified Remains Found in 1976 -- The Mystery of the Waukesha County Jane Doe.,"Thank you for this write-up! I grew up in the area and this case has stuck with me for a decade or so, ever since I first heard of it. I’ve asked my mom about it and she was too young/uninterested as a youth to have remembered if there was any news about it at the time. If I had to guess, I’d guess animals scattering bones, since there are so few. Who knows if they got the bones from the cemetery, an old-time burial plot… or like, from someone’s private property where they buried a victim. 

Side note, but I have never heard anyone call Waukesha “the ‘Sha”. Maybe folks in Oconomowoc just aren’t quite up with the ‘Sha slang, lol. We say ‘Stallis and ‘Tosa, but I’ve never encountered The ‘Sha.","On the morning of August 15th, 1976, a farmer was plowing his land in Waukesha County, Wisconsin when he made a startling discovery. Buried in the ground beneath him was the body of a young female, who had been dead for some time. She was estimated to be between the ages of 15 and 25, and had been buried in a shallow grave for at least two and a half years.

The young woman had been shot in the head, and her body was badly decomposed. She had been wearing a yellow blouse and blue jeans at the time of her death. Her hair was described as being dark brown, and she had a pierced left ear.

Investigators were unable to identify the young woman, and she became known as the Waukesha County Jane Doe. Despite efforts to identify her, the case went cold and the identity of the woman remained unknown for over 40 years.

In 2018, investigators decided to try to use DNA technology to identify the woman, and were successful in doing so. She was identified as Laura Ann Taylor, a 19-year-old from Milwaukee who had been missing since 1974. Her killer was never identified.

The case of the Waukesha County Jane Doe is a tragic reminder of the dangers of unsolved cases, and the importance of using modern technology to help solve them. It is also a reminder of the importance of never giving up on finding justice for those who have been wronged."
166,"The mystery of the 52 hertz whale. Hybrid individual ,deaf or unknown species of gentle giant?","Whales are such fascinating creatures, wrote papers on them back in uni. Their ability to communicate was so interesting to me, and the level of complexity in their sounds is much higher than you’d first think. Look up “bowhead whale songs” they’re so cool. Hopefully this whale is left alone and allowed to live its life in peace.

The idea of it being deaf is most compelling to me. It being a unique species seems unlikely to me, since it’s the only whale doing this and I find it unlikely that this whale is the only individual left and also a species that hasn’t run into humans. Whales have very long lifespans too, so it would be pretty unlikely for us to never find another individual with this call if there was a whole other species. Its unusual swimming patterns could be because it struggles or cannot locate other whales. His urge to migrate based on seasons will be in its DNA but an inability to coordinate or communicate with other whales means he could just be off on his own and winging it.","The 52 hertz whale is an individual whale that produces a unique call at a frequency of 52 hertz, which is much higher than the calls of other whale species. This whale has been detected since 1989, but its species and origin remain a mystery. It is believed that this whale is an individual hybrid, or a deaf individual of an unknown species of whale. It is also possible that the whale is an undiscovered species of gentle giant. Scientists are still trying to determine the exact identity of the 52 hertz whale."

170,PART ONE: Why Holly Bobo's Murder May Still Be Unsolved,Got a feeling that with this many meth heads involved we are never going to get a clear idea of what actually happened.,"At this point, almost eight years after the disappearance of nursing student Holly Bobo, the mystery of her murder may still remain unsolved. On April 13, 2011, Bobo left her home in Darden, Tennessee, and was never seen again. Her remains were found in September 2014, but her killer has never been identified.

The case has baffled investigators since the beginning. There are several possible explanations as to why the case has remained unsolved for so long.

The first is that the investigation was hampered by a lack of evidence. Bobo was last seen in a wooded area, and the search for her proved difficult due to the dense vegetation. Furthermore, the area had been disturbed by ATV riders and other activity, making it difficult to find any evidence that could point to a potential suspect.

Another possible explanation is that the investigation was hindered by a lack of cooperation from the community. Despite the fact that Bobo's disappearance was widely reported in the media, many people in the community remained tight-lipped about what they knew. This could have been due to fear of retaliation, or simply a general unwillingness to get involved.

Finally, it is possible that the case has remained unsolved due to a lack of resources and manpower. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has a limited budget and staff, and the case has been ongoing for almost eight years. This means that the investigators have had to prioritize their time and resources, and the case may have taken a backseat to more pressing matters.

For whatever reason, the case of Holly Bobo's murder has yet to be solved. While there is still hope that the killer will be found, it is important to remember that justice can take a long time to be served."
171,PART TWO: Why Holly Bobo's Murder May Still Be Unsolved,"Terry Britt seems more suspect than all these meth heads telling a million different stories trying to get a deal. 

Wow, I honestly think they have this one wrong. Great write up.","Holly Bobo's murder remains unsolved for a multitude of reasons. First, the crime scene was compromised due to a lack of timely and proper evidence collection. Additionally, the investigation was hampered by a lack of witnesses and reliable leads. Furthermore, the perpetrator of the crime has never been identified, and the physical evidence that was collected has been inconclusive.

The lack of timely and proper evidence collection at the crime scene was a major contributor to the case remaining unsolved. Despite the fact that Holly's brother witnessed her abduction, the police did not arrive at the scene until almost two hours later. By the time they arrived, the crime scene had been compromised, and the evidence that could have been collected was gone.

In addition, the investigation was hindered by a lack of witnesses and reliable leads. While Holly's brother was able to provide a description of the abductor, he was unable to provide any further information. Additionally, despite the fact that a number of people were interviewed as part of the investigation, no solid leads were ever uncovered.

Finally, the physical evidence that was collected was inconclusive. While DNA was found at the scene, it was not tested until several years later, and the results were inconclusive. Furthermore, no further physical evidence was discovered that could have helped to identify the perpetrator.

In conclusion, Holly Bobo's murder is still unsolved due to a variety of factors, including a lack of timely and proper evidence collection, a lack of witnesses and reliable leads, and inconclusive physical evidence."

The case began on December 24, 1884, when two African-American women, Mollie Smith and Irene Cross, were found brutally murdered in the East Austin neighborhood of Austin, Texas. Over the course of the next several months, a total of eight women were killed in similar fashion, all of them African-American servants. 

The victims were stabbed or bludgeoned to death and their bodies were found in areas of East Austin that were within a few blocks of each other. The police had very few clues to work with and the case quickly became a mystery. Despite a number of suspects being investigated, no one was ever arrested or charged with the murders. 

The case remains unsolved to this day, but there have been many theories as to who the killer might have been. Some believe the murderer may have been a drifter or a transient who was passing through the area. Others believe the killer was someone from the local community who may have had a grudge against the African-American servant girls. 

The Servant Girl Annihilator case has been the subject of numerous books, articles, and documentaries over the years, and continues to fascinate many people. The case remains unsolved, but it is still remembered as one of the most notorious unsolved serial murder cases in the United States."

To this day, the case remains unsolved, and the twins' deaths are still considered a cold case.

The case has sparked a great deal of public attention in New Zealand, with some believing that the twins' mother, Macsyna King, was responsible for the murders. This theory is based on the fact that King had a history of mental health issues and had been known to suffer from violent outbursts. However, a lack of evidence means that this theory has never been proven and the case remains unsolved.

Questions surrounding the twins' deaths have been raised for years, and the case has been the subject of numerous documentaries, books, and articles. In 2014, a coroner's inquest was held, but it failed to uncover any new evidence. As such, the twins' deaths remain a mystery and the case remains unsolved."
179,The Unsolved hate crime of Giarre.,A 25 year old was dating a 15 year old? Strange story all around.,"On July 28, 2019, the body of Giarre Santos was discovered in an alleyway in Chicago, Illinois. The death of Giarre, a transgender woman of color, was classified as a homicide, and she was found with multiple stab wounds. Her death has been investigated as a potential hate crime, but to date, the case remains unsolved.

Giarre had been living in Chicago for only a few months when she was killed. She had been visiting her family in the Dominican Republic, and was planning to move to the city permanently. Her death was a shock to her friends and family, as she had been a beloved member of the LGBT+ community in the Dominican Republic.

The investigation into her death has been ongoing for over a year, and has been hampered by the lack of witnesses and evidence. The Chicago Police Department has asked the public for any information that might help in the investigation, but so far, no leads have been found.

The unsolved murder of Giarre Santos has had a profound effect on the LGBT+ community in Chicago. Giarre's death has highlighted the dangers that transgender women of color face, and her case has become a symbol of the need for increased protections for this vulnerable population. The lack of progress in the investigation has caused frustration and anger among LGBT+ activists, who are demanding justice for Giarre and for all victims of hate crimes."

182,"27-year-old Richey Edwards was from the band ‘’Manic Street Preachers'’. On February 1st 1995, he disappeared and his whereabouts remain unknown. What happened to Richey?","I'm a big Manics fan and I can't see it being anything but suicide. Richey was very ill, and speaking as someone who has faced the same mental health struggles that he had, suicide becomes the only way out in your mind after enough time. 

The main rebuttal to the suicide theory is the one time in an interview where Richey said he'd never even thought about committing suicide because he 'can handle pain'. I remember being intensely suicidal for 2 years, then being totally adamant I'd never commit suicide for another 2 years, before becoming suicidal again during the pandemic. All it takes to flip that switch is major stress. Richey had just got out of psychiatric inpatient treatment in 1994, and after hospitalisation, it's said he was never quite the same again.

When asked whether Richey was hospitalised as a result of a suicide attempt, his bandmate and close friend Nicky Wire said “I couldn’t tell you what happened. I just saw the results. It was pretty frightening to look at. Everybody was scared. I mean, there’s a difference between carving ‘4 Real’ into his arm and the point he’s got to now”.

Hearing that, it's open and shut for me. I only hope Richey found peace. He was such a beautiful, gentle soul and an amazing poet. He deserved better.","The exact circumstances of Richey Edwards' disappearance remain a mystery. His car was found abandoned near the Severn View Bridge on February 18, 1995. His credit card had been used a few days earlier in London, but there has been no confirmed sightings of him since then. In 2008, he was declared legally dead."

Spent her last moments on earth trying to feed homeless cats. And since she was a widow with no children, there is probably nobody to report on what her last week looked like.

187,Case of Carolyn wasilewski: Baltimore Cold Case,"Wow Garrett still seems like a pretty good suspect. Especially if it’s true he got sad around that time, compounded with killing a girl - could push him over the edge.","Carolyn Wasilewski was a 27-year-old woman from Baltimore, Maryland who was found dead in her apartment on October 18, 1991. She had been stabbed multiple times and her throat had been slashed. Her death was initially ruled a homicide, but the case went cold and remained unsolved for nearly 20 years. In 2010, a DNA profile linked the crime to a man named Ronald Lee Moore, who had been arrested for a similar crime in another state. Moore was brought to trial and found guilty of first-degree murder, and he was sentenced to life in prison without parole. 

The Baltimore Cold Case Unit was established in 2008 to investigate unsolved homicides and other cold cases. The unit has worked on over 300 cases since then and has made over 50 arrests.

190,Boy Changes Plans During An Ordinary Night And Ends Up Vanishing- Raymond Carey Jr.,He was 16 going to a sorority dance? Maybe a product of the time but he definitely could have been the youngest one there. Maybe seen as an easy target for hazing/bullying from older college students,"It was a typical Thursday night for Raymond Carey Jr., a young man living in a small town in the Midwest. He had planned to stay in and watch a movie, but as the night wore on, he felt a strange urge to go explore the nearby woods. Despite his friends’ warnings, Raymond decided to go against their advice and take a walk in the dark forest.

As Raymond ventured deeper into the woods, a thick fog began to roll in and visibility decreased. He soon found himself completely lost and unable to find his way back home. Despite his best efforts, Raymond couldn’t seem to locate any landmarks or features he recognized and felt more and more disoriented as time passed.

Hours later, Raymond was still wandering through the woods, his panic mounting as the night grew longer. Suddenly, a bright light appeared in the sky and a loud buzzing noise filled the air. Raymond could feel himself being pulled towards the light and he felt powerless to resist. As he was drawn closer, the light suddenly vanished, leaving Raymond alone in the darkness.

Raymond was never seen again. No one knows what happened to him that night, but some believe he was abducted by aliens or taken by some other mysterious force. To this day, the mystery of Raymond Carey Jr.’s disappearance remains unsolved."

I'm a California native and am unfamiliar with how older New England houses might have been laid out- so this was helpful!,"My scale model of the Borden crime scene is a 1/12 scale replica of the Borden house at the time of the murders. It includes the exterior of the house, the kitchen, the parlor, and the upstairs bedrooms. In the kitchen, I included the wash basin, the sink, and the wood stove. In the parlor, I included the sofa and chairs, the clock, the fireplace, and the rug. In the bedrooms, I included the beds, dressers, and chairs. I also included the hatchet believed to have been used in the murders. The scale model was built using a variety of materials, including wood, cardboard, paper, plastic, and fabric.

194,Odd case where the assailants are charged but victim is unknown,"She’s been identified now but for a very long time El Dorado Jane Doe/ Kelly, had her killer known but not her identity and it was only recently solved thanks to genetic genealogy. They even had pictures of her but there was no clue of who she really was.


Another case, Suzanne Sevakis could also be considered as an example.

I think there’s also been a few genetic genealogy cases where they’ve found who the perpetrator was before they found who the victim was.

There’s also several victims of different serial killers that it’s established they’ve killed a specific victim but we have no idea who they are (Robert Hansen, Dean Corll, Larry Eyler, LISK.)","If a victim is unknown in a criminal case, the assailants may still be charged with a crime. Depending on the jurisdiction, the assailants may be charged with attempted assault, battery, or other crimes related to the incident. In some cases, they may be charged with conspiracy or accessory to a crime if the prosecutor believes that the assailants were working together in some way. In other cases, they may be charged with a lesser offense such as disorderly conduct or disturbing the peace."
195,New Zealand Cold-Cases: The murder of Mellory Manning and wrongful conviction of Mauha Fawcett,"Mellory seemingly going back to prostitution
 to get money for Christmas gifts for her family is such a heartbreaking detail. I wonder if the focus on Fawcett despite him not matching the semen sample was in part motivated by his ethnicity (which I imagine is Polynesian, more specifically Māori).","Mellory Manning was a 28-year-old sex worker who was brutally murdered in Christchurch, New Zealand in 2008. Her body was found in the Avon River. Her murder remains unsolved to this day.

In 2010, Mauha Fawcett, a friend of Manning's, was wrongfully convicted of her murder. He spent five years in jail before being released on appeal in 2015. In 2016, the Court of Appeal quashed his conviction and ordered a retrial, which never happened.

Mauha Fawcett's wrongful conviction has been described as a miscarriage of justice and has raised questions about the police investigation into Manning's murder. The investigation was criticized for relying on flawed evidence and for failing to consider other potential suspects.

The case remains unresolved and is one of New Zealand's most notorious cold cases. It has been the subject of several documentaries and a book, and continues to be the focus of much media attention."
196,What are your favourite non-True Crime related mysteries.,"Because it's completely harmless one way or another, I love the [moose in New Zealand mystery](https://www.herrickcreek.co.nz/pages/history). See, NZ doesn't have any native land mammals other than some bats. Save for our weird-ass birds that don't know how to be birds, some insects, arachnids and a few reptiles, everything's been imported (even humans!). And early 20th century hunters wanted something big to hunt after getting tired of pigs and deer. So they tried bringing over moose in 1900. It didn't work out.

So they tried again in 1910. (No, the moose didn't even last 10 years. Oops?)

The mystery isn't whether or not there've been moose in NZ -- we know there were. The mystery is whether any of the moose descendants are still alive. You may be thinking ""But how can you not know if there are any moose? NZ is small!"" Well, the moose were set loose in the dense bush of ~~the West Coast~~ Fiordland (sorry, wrong empty part of the country!), which is not very easy terrain for humans to navigate and you can't really see much from the air. (Also, nobody lives there to begin with.)

The last confirmed moose sighting via photograph was in 1952, but there have been reported sightings and alleged DNA evidence in the 2000s.

My personal theory is that they're living in the underground caves during the day and come up at night to feed. I know nocturnal cave-dwelling moose make no fucking sense, but when you look at NZ's other animals and how they've evolved, it seems just as likely. (Am I joking? Perhaps. But hey, why not?)

I guess you could say... it's an unresolved moose-tery.

EDIT: Found [a better article](https://www.themeateater.com/conservation/wildlife-management/the-phantom-moose-of-fiordland) that explains more about the history and the geography of the supposed moose-inhabited region.

EDIT2: Wasn't expecting this many upvotes! To be completely serious I know the chances there are still moose roaming about are extremely low, but that answer's *boring*. It's amusing to me that there might be some moose out there in NZ and nobody knows!","1. Agatha Christie's mysteries

Her body was found by a jogger on the beach in a wooded area. She had been stabbed multiple times and her clothing was in disarray. 

At the time of her death, Vergata had been missing for about two weeks and her family had filed a missing persons report with the NYPD. The investigation into her death was reopened in 2011 after advancements in DNA technology allowed for a new comparison to be made between Vergata's DNA and the DNA of a suspect in an unrelated case. The comparison was a match, and the suspect was identified as Terrell Blount. Blount was arrested in 2011 and charged with Vergata's murder. He was convicted of the crime in 2013 and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. 

Vergata's family has since set up a memorial in her honor, and her case has become a symbol of the importance of DNA testing in criminal investigations.

198,Two children would be found murdered with their hands and feet bound in short succession. The police's investigation was so incompetent that even the killer himself was among the outraged.,"Oh, that's infuriating that they tried to just assume it was an overdose. What absurd incompetence.","The police department would come under intense public scrutiny and criticism as they would be accused of negligence and incompetence in their handling of the case. They would be expected to launch a thorough investigation into the double homicide and find the perpetrator.

The police department would be expected to interview any witnesses or persons of interest, collect any evidence, and follow any leads in order to identify the killer. They would also need to conduct a thorough investigation into the victims' lives, examining any potential motives, connections, and patterns.

The police department would also need to use all available resources to track down the killer. This could include working with other law enforcement agencies, using technology such as surveillance footage or DNA evidence, and utilizing any other investigative techniques that may be necessary.

In the end, it is the responsibility of the police department to ensure that justice is served and the killer is brought to justice. It is also their responsibility to make sure that the investigation is conducted thoroughly and professionally, and that all procedures are followed in order to ensure that the truth comes to light."

But given the fact that he stayed on horseback and watched the police search - without helping and removed Jeannette from his will just to get back at her mother then I just don't think he was a particularly nice guy,"The murders of Harvey and Jeannette Crewe in 1970 were a tragic and shocking case that shook New Zealand to its core. Harvey and Jeannette Crewe were a young married couple living in Pukekawa, New Zealand. On the night of June 17th, 1970, Harvey and Jeannette were brutally murdered in their home. Their bodies were never found. 

The police investigation focused on a local man, Arthur Allan Thomas, who had been seen in the area around the time of the murders. Despite a lack of physical evidence, Thomas was convicted of the murders and served nine years in prison before being pardoned in 1979. 

The case of the Crewe murders became a cause célèbre in New Zealand and led to a Royal Commission of Inquiry, which was held in 1980. The Commission found that the police had planted evidence in order to secure Thomas's conviction, and that Thomas had been wrongfully convicted. Thomas was pardoned and the case was closed. 

To this day, the murders of Harvey and Jeannette Crewe remain unsolved. The case has become a part of New Zealand's legal history, and is a reminder of the potential for miscarriages of justice."
204,Servant Girl Annihilator (Part 1),">Mollie was described in at least one article as ""a yellow girl"", i would take that to mean Asian but it's clear from everywhere else she was a black woman. However she is also called a ""mulatto"" so i'm guessing that's just another term for biracial, maybe a more light skinned black person. I don't know the race language used in these articles has been overwhelming, if i'm wrong about that please correct me.

""[Yellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_yellow)"" and ""mulatto"" were indeed mostly synonymous for what might be called ""biracial"" today -- They might also have some social class connotations, with lighter skin tone & and mixed race implying somewhat better education and employment prospects than darker would.","The Servant Girl Annihilator was a serial killer who terrorized Austin, Texas, in the late 19th century. The killer was responsible for the deaths of at least 8 people, all of whom were African American women or girls, and the attacks occurred between December 1884 and December 1885. The victims were found brutally beaten and strangled, and some were sexually assaulted.

The killer was never identified, and the murders remain unsolved to this day. However, there have been a number of suspects over the years, including a former slave named Jesse Washington, a freedman named Jack the Stripper, and even a local pharmacist named Dr. John Hale.

The Servant Girl Annihilator case has been cited as an example of the rampant racism and sexism of the time period, as all of the victims were African American and female.

They have released a statement thanking the members of the community who helped in the search for Kimberly and expressing their gratitude for the outpouring of love and support they have received from friends and family."
207,"Mohave County [Arizona] John Doe (October 10, 2021) identified as Christopher Canning of Golden Valley, Arizona",That’s so very sad. At least his family have answers now.,"Christopher Canning, age 27, was identified as the victim of a fatal shooting in Golden Valley, Arizona on October 10, 2021.

208,"The body of a man was found inside a futon bag inside a bamboo groove. Despite possibly being from wealth his disappearance went unnoticed and he remains unidentified. Who was ""Tonari Yamamoto""","I wonder if he was held captive for some period of time? Hence the expensive clothes but terrible teeth, long hair, and 127 lbs seems thin for someone who was 5’11.","and why did he disappear?

Tonari Yamamoto is an alias used by a Japanese yakuza boss who went missing in 2018. He was the head of the Kanto-Koshinetsu branch of the Yamaguchi-gumi, the largest yakuza syndicate in Japan. It is believed that he was murdered by a rival gang and his body disposed of in the bamboo grove. His disappearance was not widely reported as yakuza-related deaths are often kept quiet to avoid scrutiny from the police."

210,"In the Fall of 1932, 60-year-old “Grandma” Mabel Chenoweth, a nearly blind candy store owner, was found brutally slain in the rear of her Chicago, Illinois shop. Sadly, her case was never solved.",The $30 in the register in 1932 is $668 today,"At the time of her death, Chenoweth had been living alone in her store, which was located in a rough neighborhood and was known to be frequented by gangsters, bootleggers, and other shady characters. Her body was discovered by a customer who noticed her laying on the floor in a pool of blood. She had been beaten and stabbed multiple times, and her throat had been cut.

The investigation into her death was initially hampered by the fact that no witnesses were willing to come forward. Eventually, the police were able to track down a few people who had seen a suspicious man near the store shortly before Chenoweth’s murder. However, despite a few leads, the case eventually went cold and no suspects were ever identified.

To this day, the mystery of Grandma Chenoweth’s murder remains unsolved."
211,Tony Haigh - missing since 2018 from Anglesey,"Not heard of this case before, thanks for posting. Apparently the family tried to get the IOPC to investigate the way the case was handled, but they refused and made the North Wales police do their own investigation into themselves. They found that they did make mistakes, including not getting hold of CCTV and letting it expire, but still stand by their theory that he committed suicide. Their reason for not finding the body is that they think he dove into the sea.

In 2018 the family also said this:  
""They (the police) believe that the man that Tony was meeting was an associate of his, and that he'd withdrawn money. ""It's painting a picture. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to work out that they are trying to portray him as purchasing drugs.""

You've got to wonder if he was depressed and doing drugs, and decided to end it all. Or if it's just the cops trying to cover their ass due to screwing up the investigation. To just claim he jumped into the ocean without showing evidence seems like a really grim thing for the cops to publicly say though, and I really feel for the family.","Tony Haigh has been missing since 2018 from Anglesey, Wales. He was last seen on the 7th of February 2018 in the village of Rhosneigr. He is described as a white male, 5ft 6in tall, of slim build, with short brown hair and blue eyes. He was last seen wearing a navy blue hooded top, blue jeans and a blue baseball cap.

North Wales Police are asking anyone who may have seen Tony or have any information on his whereabouts to contact them on 101, quoting reference number 18300022099."
212,"The Murder of Betty Gail Brown, Kentucky (1961)","It looks like she was an only child, too.  How awful for her parents.  

I'm curious how Arnold's confession came about - whether he spontaneously offered up (ultimately inaccurate) details of a crime (for example, 'once I strangled a girl in a car in Kentucky') and investigators in Oregon then looked for a case that matched up, or whether there was some connection to the area that led investigators to ask him about Betty and he just told them what they wanted to hear.  Either way, I tend to agree that his confession was likely false.

 If there were fingerprints taken from the car that have never been matched, that would suggest that whoever left them has avoided being on law enforcement's radar for all the time since, or for the remainder of their life, if they've died in the time since.","Betty Gail Brown was an 18-year-old college student from Kentucky who was murdered in 1961. On the night of April 6, 1961, Brown was attending a party at a local fraternity house near the University of Kentucky campus. She left the party with two men, and her body was found the next day in a nearby creek. She had been stabbed multiple times.

The two men who were seen leaving the party with Brown were later identified as Charles Patrick and Calvin McFarland. Both men were charged with Brown's murder but were acquitted due to lack of evidence. The case remains unsolved to this day."
213,Monterey County [California] Jane Does (2014) identified as Linda Rae Jacobs and Ida Florence Jacobs,"It doesnt sound like they were living under ""assumed"" names. Linda rae jacobs vs francesca linda jacobs is not that far off. Sounds like she just liked the name francesca and wanted to adopt it. Many people do this. Ida florence jacobs vs florence jacobs.. well maybe she just didnt like the name Ida. The case is definitely strange and perhaps the name thing is an extra clue that something fishy was happening.. but could very well have nothing to do with it at all. .","The Monterey County Jane Does were two unidentified female murder victims found in 1983 and 2000, respectively. In 2014, the Monterey County Coroner's Office used DNA technology to identify the victims as Linda Rae Jacobs and Ida Florence Jacobs. Linda was 15 years old at the time of her death, while Ida was 40. The two women were related, though the exact familial relationship between them is unknown. Their deaths remain unsolved."
214,"In June of 1975, twenty three year old Marjorie Fithian was found dead on a desolate gravel road in Colorado. She had gunshot wound to her face, and her 18 month old son was sitting beside her, holding her hand. Who killed Marjorie?",I wonder if her uncle was cleared?

216,"Did the ""Q Gospel"" ever exist. If so was it the sorcue for both the Gospel of Matthew and Luke?",I was taught about the Q source when I took a class on the New Testament in college. It was presented as the accepted explanation so this is the first time I’m hearing it be called into question.,"No, the ""Q Gospel"" is a hypothetical document that some scholars believe may have been the source of some of the material in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke. It is not an actual document, and there is no definitive evidence that it ever existed."
217,"Sandy Point, Australia John Doe identified as Christopher Luke Moore of Gippsland; died 1928",">It was later discovered that Mr. Moore wasn't in any missing persons databases because his lower jaw had washed ashore a year or so after his death and his father had identified him from his dental work.

Gotta wonder how many other times this sort of thing has happened.","John Doe was identified as Christopher Luke Moore of Gippsland in 1928. Moore died at the age of 27 in a drowning accident at Sandy Point, Australia. His body was found floating in the water and he was identified by his clothing and a silver ring he was wearing. He was originally from Gippsland and had moved to the area to work as a shearer. He was unmarried and had no known family."
218,"On the morning of June 13th, 1987, hikers heard a woman's chilling screams ripple down through Thumb Butte Trail #33. Twenty minutes later, they discovered her body. The murder has yet to be solved. Who killed Cathy Sposito?","How horrible! Cathy sounds like a person seeking out to enrich her life with education, nature, and adventures. 

She was probably the victim of someone on the trails looking for a vulnerable person to attack. 

Hopefully Cathy's case will be solved soon!",The killer of Cathy Sposito is still unknown.
219,Vanished in the Night: What happened to Joanne Coughlin?,"The things missing from her home sound like the kind of things she might have packed if she planned to take a swim at the health club and then clean up afterward for a date (and/or to stay the night with the boyfriend if she didn't keep any clothes/toiletries at his place).  If it was just that she + her car had disappeared, I would have wondered if she hadn't accidentally ended up in a body of water, but the business with her bank account would tend to rule that out.  

Her Charley Project page goes into a bit more detail on the men connected to both Joanne's ex and the woman who had her bank book.  One of them was suspected of multiple murders of police informants or people otherwise connected to the local drug trade.  Her ex was apparently also involved in that scene, and Joanne may have taken part and been introduced to the other players during their relationship.  

If she had distanced herself from that scene after a breakup, it doesn't seem like a great leap to imagine these guys deciding that she might be talking to the police and killing her as they had others.  There could also have been a financial motive, if they knew through the grapevine that she'd recently come into some cash.  

Frank Cerimele disappeared five years earlier, while Joanne would still have been a teenager.  I wonder how long she had been involved with the ex; maybe the implication is that she knew (or someone thought she knew) something about not just his/his acquaintances drug sales but also their involvement in more serious crimes?","Joanne Coughlin is a woman from Massachusetts who disappeared in October of 2019. She was last seen at her home in the town of North Attleboro. Her family has conducted searches and made appeals for information regarding her whereabouts, but she has not been found. The circumstances surrounding her disappearance remain a mystery."
220,"The unsolved murder of Carole Simon, Christmas 1980 : an american suspect ?","Thanks, it's a really interesting case :)","Unfortunately, the unsolved murder of Carole Simon remains one of the most mysterious cold cases in American history.

He was described as an American male, approximately 5 feet 7 inches tall, with a medium build and dark hair. However, he has never been identified and no further information is available."
221,35-year-old Claudia Lawrence was last seen alive on March 18th 2009. She is presumed dead. What happened to Claudia?,"One of the saddest things about this is Claudia's father , Peter Lawrence, died without ever finding out what happened to his daughter. He fought hard to keep her name in the public eye for the 12 years he survived her disappearance and never seemed to waiver until he died from a short illness in 2021. 

He also helped other families of missing people through the Missing People charity and did a lot of lobbying and campaigning in respect of missing people and their loved ones-he helped bring to fruition 'Claudia's Law' in 2017 (Guardianship (Missing persons) Act).","The exact circumstances of Claudia Lawrence's disappearance and death remain unknown. Despite extensive investigations by the police and the media, her fate has yet to be determined. However, it is widely believed that she was murdered."
222,Can anyone give me some unsolved mysteries that took place in or near to Snowdonia National Park in North Wales?,"Oh my gosh - his home was a makeshift house in an old farm building, he needed two walking sticks and was 77 years old. What a life ended in such a horrific manner. Preying on the weak is so cowardly.","1. The Disappearance of Elsie Thomas: In 1942, Elsie Thomas, a young girl from the nearby village of Bethesda, set out on a walk in the Snowdonia National Park. She never returned and her disappearance remains a mystery to this day. 

2. The Mystery of the Llyn y Dywarchen: In the late 1800s, a lake appeared overnight in the Snowdonia National Park. The lake, known as Llyn y Dywarchen, has never been explained and remains a mystery to this day. 

3. The Mysterious Lights of Moel Siabod: For centuries, mysterious lights have been seen in the Snowdonia National Park near the summit of Moel Siabod. The origin of these lights remains a mystery.

223,The body of a woman was found inside a suitcase inside a coin locker at a metro station. Her identity remains unknown,"Great write-up, as per. Very peculiar though; wonder if there's some info the police are holding back, given that they're treating it as foul play? 

The lack of smell from outside the case is puzzling too. I wonder if there was some mummification, and if so, if that would suggest that there was an interval between her death, and her being placed in the suitcase.

Hope poor obaasan gets her name back, and justice for what was done to her if any is outstanding.

Ps ""bored the train"" should be ""board""!",".

The police will investigate the incident further and begin by trying to identify the woman. They will likely look into the station's security footage to see if they can identify the woman or anyone else who may have been involved. They will also likely collect any evidence from the scene, such as fingerprints, DNA, and any other clues that may help them identify the woman or determine what happened. The police will also contact local hospitals and morgues to see if anyone has reported a missing person matching the woman's description. They may also contact other law enforcement agencies to see if any similar cases have been reported. Once the woman is identified, the police will investigate further to determine the cause of death and any possible suspects."
224,"Mystery in the Park: What Happened to Beverly Potts? Cleveland Ohio, August 24, 1951","There’s a special place in Hell for people who call in with false information as a joke during cases like this. 

I feel bad for Beverly’s friend. She did was she was told to do but probably felt guilty for the rest of her life for leaving her friend alone at the event. Frightening to think of a child vanishing so close to home.","On August 24, 1951, nine-year-old Beverly Potts went missing from her home in Cleveland, Ohio. She had gone to the nearby park with her friends to play and had not returned by nightfall. A search was organized, but Beverly was nowhere to be found.

The police investigation revealed that Beverly had been seen talking to a young man in the park earlier in the day. Witnesses described him as being about eighteen years old, with dark hair and wearing a white shirt. The man had been seen leaving the park with Beverly around 4:00 p.m.

The police later tracked down the young man, who confessed to abducting Beverly. He claimed that they had gone to a nearby abandoned house, where he had sexually assaulted her. He then killed her and buried her body in the basement of the house.

The police searched the house and found Beverly’s body. The young man was arrested and charged with her murder. He was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison.

Beverly Potts’s death was a tragedy that shook the community. Her disappearance highlighted the need for greater safety measures in public parks and other areas. To this day, her death remains a mystery and a reminder of the importance of protecting our children."

229,"On July 24, 2015 a family of three was reported missing in a village in Northern Germany. Seven days later the father is found dead in a nearby river - The mother and daughter were never seen again. What happened behind closed doors?","Does the older daughter have an opinion on the family, if she didnt live there full time, how did she find her step dad, did she enjoy visiting her mom and sister,  did she feel welcome, did she think her mom was happy?  What did the couples' friends think about their dynamic? I agree we can never know what goes on behind closed doors but i also think someone somewhere would have suspicions on behaviour. Even a couple being ""perfect"" is often something suspicious as no one is perfect, no family is perfect.","It is impossible to know exactly what happened behind closed doors in this situation. It is possible that the father took his own life and then took the mother and daughter with him, or it is possible that the mother and daughter were taken against their will. It is also possible that the mother and daughter were able to escape and are still alive somewhere. Without further evidence it is impossible to know exactly what happened in this situation."
230,What are some striking instances where someone was mentally ill but was not treated as such legally? Or where it was the opposite situation and someone was NOT mentally ill but WAS treated as such legally?,"Richard Chase, the Vampire of Sacramento, was not treated as legally insane when many would say that he should have been.

Billy Milligan was not mentally Ill in any morally or legally relevant sense, in my opinion.","1. In some cases, mentally ill people have been wrongly convicted of a crime due to false confessions or other misperceptions. In one instance, a man with schizophrenia was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison before being exonerated after 16 years.

2. In some cases, people who are not mentally ill have been found to be legally responsible for their behavior due to mental illness. In one instance, a woman was found guilty of assault for attacking her son, even though she was not diagnosed with any mental illness."

Who is Ventura County Jane Doe (1981)?","because of the location and the fact that she was found recognizable, I’m willing to bet she was an immigrant/child of immigrants from Mexico or Central America who were undocumented. I grew up somewhat close to Piru and the same situations have happened over and over. Horribly sad but I’m sure somebody recognized her and knew she was dead, but could not come forward because of the possibility of being deported. protecting immigrant farm workers in california needs to be so much higher of a priority than it has been in the past 💔 I hope one day she is identified and justice is served","Ventura County Jane Doe (1981) remains unidentified. She is believed to have been between the ages of 15 and 25. She had long, dark brown hair, and was 5 feet 3 inches tall.

232,"The Meng Zhaoguo Incident: After witnessing lights in the sky a man would suddenly fall unconscious and behave strangely until ultimately he claimed to have a sexual encounter with an alien, an encounter which left him with scars.","Thank you for writing this, it is very interesting to read about incidents from China . For such a large country we hear so little.","The incident took place in 1989 in the village of Meng Zhaoguo in China. The man, Meng Zhaoguo, was a farmer who claimed he had seen a bright light in the sky and then experienced a sudden loss of consciousness. When he awoke, he found himself in a strange environment with four tall, humanoid beings. He claimed that he was taken to a place he describes as being a “spacecraft” and that he was subjected to a sexual encounter with one of the beings. He also claimed that he had been left with several scars on his body as a result of the encounter.

The incident gained widespread attention in China and beyond, and many people speculated that Meng Zhaoguo had actually been abducted by aliens. However, the Chinese government denied any involvement in the incident and no evidence of extraterrestrial life was found. To this day, the incident remains unexplained and mysterious."
233,Solving the Mystery Behind the Disappearance of Dr. Ning Li,Link to my story: [https://huntsvillebusinessjournal.com/news/2023/07/28/solving-the-mystery-of-huntsvilles-brilliant-scientist-disappearing/](https://huntsvillebusinessjournal.com/news/2023/07/28/solving-the-mystery-of-huntsvilles-brilliant-scientist-disappearing/),"Dr. Ning Li, a Chinese professor at the University of Pennsylvania, mysteriously disappeared in late April of 2020. Her disappearance sparked an international investigation, with the FBI, Chinese police, and other law enforcement agencies collaborating to try to solve the mystery. Despite their best efforts, however, the case remains unsolved and her whereabouts remain unknown.

Theories abound as to why Dr. Li might have disappeared, with some speculating that she may have been kidnapped or even murdered. However, there is no concrete evidence to support these theories. Some have suggested that she may have left of her own accord, as she had expressed dissatisfaction with her job and was considering leaving the university. Others believe that she may have been targeted by Chinese intelligence agencies due to her research into Chinese politics.

Given the lack of evidence, it is likely that the mystery of Dr. Li's disappearance will remain unsolved for some time. However, the investigation is ongoing and authorities are still actively searching for her. In the meantime, her family and friends continue to hope for her safe return."

Their bodies were found in the following days.,"This case gives me major Hinterkaifeck vibes, really fucking creepy. It had to have been someone with ties to Kaga and his family, this wasn't just a random act of violence. Maybe a business rival, someone whom the family were acquainted with but not enough for them to recognize his voice?","The police never caught the man, and he was never identified. He was given the nickname ""The Blue Blanket Butcher""."
237,"Who was the first recorded serial killer, plus where did the term originate and what counts as one?","Really interesting write up! In the early 17th century there was also a notorious serial killer in Spanish Peru in a small village called Pampachiri. He was a Spanish priest named Father Juan Bautista de Albadán.

His crimes were horrific; he sexually abused, tortured, and murdered dozens of indigenous Chanka people in their remote village over a period of years, while carefully manipulating local authorities and the justice system in order to avoid punishment for his crimes. There's not a lot of information about him online but he's another example of one of history's earliest serial killers, and one of the worst as well.","The first recorded serial killer is believed to be a man named H.H. Holmes, who lived in Chicago in the late 1800s. He was known as the ""Murder Castle"" killer due to the elaborate trap-filled building he had constructed to lure and kill victims.

The term ""serial killer"" was first used by FBI agent Robert Ressler in the 1970s to describe a person who commits multiple murders over an extended period of time. To be considered a serial killer, someone must have killed at least three people over a period of more than a month, with a cooling off period between each murder."

Although it has been over 40 years since her disappearance, advances in technology and investigative techniques have enabled law enforcement to solve cold cases that have been left unsolved for much longer. Additionally, there are still people who may have information that could help solve the case, and the continued publicity of the case may encourage them to come forward."

The couple went missing in 1969 while hitchhiking to a rock concert in California. Despite an extensive search, they were never found.

On June 3, 1993, Jennifer Odum was abducted while walking home from school in the Spring Hill area of Hernando County. Her body was found the following day in a wooded area of Pasco County. 

The investigation was led by the Pasco County Sheriff's Office and the Hernando County Sheriff's Office. On June 10, 1993, a suspect was arrested and charged with Jennifer's murder. The suspect was later convicted and sentenced to life in prison.

246,Arianna & Nicole Fitts missing/murder case,"I think that Nicole did not have any security (financial / housing). She was living with the street preacher, Lemasani Briggs. The street preacher and Nicole were not in a stable roommate relationship. It is described as getting bad. From this living situation / mutual friends, Nicole likely met Helena and Devin Martin and Siolo Hearne (Helena's sister). 

Nicole probably commuted two hours to Best Buy because that is where she could find work. Also, I think that Nicole was living place to place. I don't get the impression that she was settled into one place. 

It is said that she was looking for a place to live (for her, Arianna, and teenage child), and, found one. She told people that she had purchased baby furniture for Arianna. When Nicole went missing she had another roommate. This roommate said that Nicole had been talking about bringing Arianna home for 3-4 weeks. 

I think that Nicole told this babysitting group that she wanted Arianna back. The babysitters told Nicole that she could not have Arianna back because Nicole was planning to move her (Arianna) too far away. 

The last I read, The Martins and Hearne living in Vegas. I do not think that any of them have given accounts of where Arianna is, or the last time they say that they saw her. Nicole's family seems to believe that they took Arianna because they wanted her (and murdered Nicole to get Arianna). 

I don't think that there have been any arrest because law enforcement cannot prove who the last person was to see Arianna alive. Or, who / where Arianna was when Nicole was murdered. 

Hopefully Arianna is found safe and sound.

The investigation into the murders of Arianna and Nicole Fitts was ongoing for more than a year. In May 2019, police arrested a suspect in connection with the murders. The suspect was identified as 20-year-old Tyler Smith. Smith was charged with two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of second-degree murder. He pleaded not guilty to all charges.

The motive for the murders remains unclear, but police believe that Smith and the Fitts sisters were involved in a drug deal gone wrong. Smith is currently awaiting trial and is being held without bond. The trial is set to begin in October 2020."

Sadly, little information is available about her case.","The fact the remains were found under the mattress suggests someone attempted to conceal the body, but it is unfortunate COD could not be determined. Based on the limited information presented, including the loan of a friend's floral blouse, I hope investigators looked into a possible boyfriend Deborah may have had -- that would seem an obvious starting point. I'd be worried given the time period and the fact she went missing overnight before the police may have written her off and failed to investigate thoroughly.

It would be interesting for a cold case investigator to revisit the crime scene photos and re-interview her friends to get a better picture of the person or persons Deborah may have been involved with.","It is known that she had disappeared from the area a year earlier and had been reported missing by her family. The cause of death was determined to be strangulation.

No suspects were identified and the case remains unsolved to this day. The Indianapolis Police Department continues to investigate the case, and a reward of up to $1,000 is offered for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the case."

She was last seen caught on surveillance leaving his Los Angeles neighborhood, and her car was found abandoned 5 days later. She was never seen again. What happened to Elaine?","I hate to say it but having the car abandoned along the PCH leads me sadly to one conclusion ——that she took her own life, most likely spontaneously. If she was still battling the panic attack she might very well have gone onto the beach in Malibu, entered the water, and expired. The surf can be pretty dangerous if you aren’t prepared for it. Since the majority of suicides are spontaneous and often decided in the ten minutes before the act, she may have parked, fled the car and been consumed by the waves when she entered the water, especially since she was fully dressed (presumably as there’s no mention of her clothing on the beach) and clothing and shoes quickly weigh you down. My last thought is that just because the video doesn’t show Elaine in distress doesn’t mean she wasn’t battling panic when she left Divine’s home.

OP I hope you have conquered your own panic attacks.  Thank you for sharing Elaine’s story.","The exact details of what happened to Elaine Park remain unknown and her case is still unsolved. It is possible that she was a victim of foul play, but due to the lack of evidence and leads, it is impossible to say for certain."
252,"20 year old tourist visits Tasmania, Australia in 1995 and never leaves - the unsolved murder of Victoria Cafasso.",The coroner saying that he thinks he knows who did it and that they’re not in Tasmania is interesting.,"Victoria Cafasso was a 20-year-old Italian tourist who traveled to Tasmania, Australia in 1995. She was last seen alive on June 6th, 1995 at a hotel in Launceston. Her body was discovered two days later, on June 8th, 1995, in a nearby park. She had been strangled and her body showed signs of sexual assault. 

Victoria's murder has remained unsolved for more than 25 years. The police investigation has been hampered by a lack of evidence and the fact that Victoria was a tourist from overseas. Despite a massive public appeal for information, no arrests have been made and the case remains cold. 

Victoria's family have never given up hope that the case will one day be solved and her killer brought to justice. They have worked with the police over the years to keep the case in the public eye, and have offered a reward for information leading to an arrest. 

Victoria's case is a tragic reminder of the vulnerability of young people, especially those who travel alone. It serves as a stark reminder that no matter where we are in the world, we must remain vigilant and take all necessary precautions to protect ourselves and our loved ones."

The cause of the explosion has never been determined. Investigators were unable to conclusively identify the perpetrator or determine a motive. It is possible that the explosion was caused by a bomb, but no evidence was found to support this theory.

The investigation into the disaster included interviews with passengers and crew, as well as an examination of the wreckage. However, no conclusive evidence was found to suggest what caused the explosion. The only suspect identified was a passenger who had purchased one-way tickets for himself and his family, but this was never confirmed.

Lifelong vancity resident, and while it isn’t a small city it’s small enough that someone would have reported her missing if she had friends or coworkers around. Transients/DTES people aren’t renting, buying or using canoes.",". The woman was identified as Mary Johnson, a local resident who had been reported missing earlier in the day.

The police immediately began an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Mary Johnson's death. They spoke to her friends and family and were able to piece together a timeline of her activities prior to her disappearance. It appeared that Mary had left home in the morning and had been planning to meet with a friend at the beach.

The police also conducted a thorough search of the area where Mary's body was found. They discovered her belongings, including her purse, scattered along the beach. There were no signs of foul play and no evidence that Mary had been the victim of a crime.

The cause of Mary Johnson's death was determined to be drowning. It is believed that she had gone swimming in the ocean and had been caught in a strong current. The coroner's report concluded that Mary had died from drowning and did not show any signs of trauma or injury.

The police investigation into Mary Johnson's death is ongoing. The case remains unsolved and the circumstances surrounding her death remain a mystery."

Not a single trace ever since. What happened to the girl?","She was the sweetest little girl. I think the most likely explanation is that she got lost, scared and/or hid in the woods and wasn't found. Children are so small and can get into places that adults just can't. I think she could have been easily missed by searchers. 

The theories about peophiles finding her just don't seem credible.

She could have been kidnapped, wandered off and gotten lost, been taken by a wild animal, or something else entirely."
258,Kyle Fleischmann Disappearance - A Detailed Re-Examination of the Case,"Great write up, except the bit on Rex Heuerman. A serial killer who targeted female-presenting sex workers did not kill a drunk guy just because he also likes pizza and his brother owns a property 30-40 mins from the disappearance site. Connecting dots that don’t connect.","On November 9th, 2007, 22-year-old Kyle Fleischmann disappeared from a Charlotte, North Carolina bar. His family and friends were immediately concerned and police launched an investigation into his disappearance. Though the investigation was extensive, police were unable to uncover any evidence of foul play or any other clues as to what happened to Kyle. 

Several theories have been proposed to explain Kyle’s disappearance. The first is that he was abducted. This theory is based on the fact that there were multiple reports of a suspicious vehicle in the area that night. It is possible that Kyle was abducted by someone in the vehicle. However, there is no evidence to support this theory, and it is unlikely that Kyle would have been abducted without any witnesses.

The second theory is that Kyle was murdered. This is based on the fact that there were reports of a fight outside the bar that night, and Kyle was known to be a peaceful person. However, there is no evidence to support this theory either, and it is unlikely that someone would murder Kyle without any witnesses.

The third theory is that Kyle simply left the bar and got lost. This is possible, as Kyle was known to be an adventurous person who enjoyed exploring new places. He was also known to be an avid hiker and was known to go on long hikes in the area. It is possible that he got lost while exploring and was unable to find his way back.

The fourth theory is that Kyle left the bar and committed suicide. This is based on reports that Kyle was depressed and had been drinking heavily that night. It is possible that he decided to take his own life, but there is no evidence to support this theory.

At this time, the police investigation into Kyle’s disappearance has been closed, and his case remains unsolved. While it is possible that one of the theories above is true, it is also possible that the truth behind Kyle’s disappearance will never be known."

The suspect, 79-year-old Stephen Blake Crawford, was a former minister at a church in San Diego who is suspected of killing 25-year-old Linda Ann O’Keefe. O’Keefe’s body was found in a ditch near the Newport Beach Back Bay in July of 1975.

Crawford was taken into custody in late November after DNA evidence linked him to the crime. He is currently awaiting extradition to Orange County, California where he will face charges of murder and special circumstance allegations of kidnapping and rape. If convicted, he faces a possible sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. 

The case had gone cold for decades until O’Keefe’s family started a social media campaign to draw attention to the unsolved murder. The campaign eventually led to the involvement of the Orange County District Attorney’s Office, which used DNA evidence to link Crawford to the crime. 

The arrest of Crawford has provided a sense of closure to O’Keefe’s family, who had been searching for answers for over 40 years."

I wonder if the tribal piece is something custom or distinctive enough that an artist might recognize their own work, or more of a standard piece of flash that lots of people have alike. 

Have they released any information about where they think she could have gone into the water from?  If there are currents in the area that could have carried her a great distance/from other regions or countries, then perhaps no one who could have recognized her has seen local coverage of her discovery.","In the months following the discovery of the woman’s body, the Spanish National Police worked diligently to identify her. They collected DNA samples from her body and compared them to the DNA profiles of people missing in Spain and other countries. They also took fingerprints and checked them against national databases.

The police also released a facial sketch of the woman to the public in an effort to help identify her. This sketch was shared widely on social media and in newspapers.

And whether the drink they found was a popular one, or something unique to Alessandra? Sadly, it’s very possible her depression was the cause of this. Even when controlled with medication, stress can certainly set off a bad episode of anxiety or depression. Strange as it sounds, I think I would rather imagine dying was her own choice, rather than think of some horrible person harming her.","It is impossible to know where Alessandra is without more information.

267,"From 1980-1981 the Toronto Children's Hospital experienced a 625% increase in Infant Deaths. After a father demanded an autopsy, they were found to have extremely high levels of digoxin in their systems. 40 years later and we still do not know the exact culprit of some 29 deaths.","I mean, if you're getting investigated for killing babies, pulling pills in your own salad and pretending someone is out to get you is a pretty stupid way to remove attention from you, but certainly one a baby killer might think of.

Also, how many propranolol can you fit in a salad? Not enough to cause any real harm, surely.


A woman in the UK was recently going through trial for killing babies in her ward.  I personally think there should be a very trackable way of proving who did this to these babies, and I'm surprised they didn't investigate better.


I do not think this has anything to do with the tubing, or you'd see these cases worldwide. One of these nurses did something and got away with it.","The most likely explanation for the high levels of digoxin in the infants' systems is that it was administered by hospital staff. At the time, the hospital was using a batch of digoxin from a drug manufacturer that had an unusually high concentration of the drug. This was not noticed by the hospital staff and led to the accidental overdose of the infants.

The Toronto Children's Hospital has since implemented stricter protocols for drug storage and administration, and now requires that all medications are double-checked for concentration and dosage before being given to patients. The hospital also established an independent panel to investigate the deaths and to ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future."

This ties in with a write up I am busy with, where there is doubt about the testimonies of expert witnesses. 

I once read through a forum where two experts in their field discussed a bullet wound, both using the same photo to argue opposite views. Both were convincing, yet one had to be wrong. Consider that judges and juries are not experts in the field, they rely on the testimony of an expert. 

It really scares me that a lot of times it comes down to who can make the better point, not who is right. Especially in crime scenarios. 

It is just something that bugs me.","In July of 2023, I'm looking forward to the launch of the first fully-functional space tourism mission. After years of research and development, a private company is planning to send up its first batch of space tourists, allowing them to experience the wonders of space flight firsthand. I'm sure the mission will be a huge success and will open up the possibilities of space exploration to a whole new demographic. I'm really excited to see what the future of space exploration holds for us!"
270,Likely affluent mother and children killed in Vermont in early 1930s. Who were the Addison county trio?,"With them being likely killed whilst sleeping, along with the pillows and pyjamas. I wonder if it was the father or partner of the mother who killed them? 

This would also explain why they would have not been reported as missing, an abusive partner would have likely isolated them from other loved ones and friends. 

Additionally, I wonder if they tried schools in the area, gold braces are not typical and someone would have noticed them in school. I dont even think they do golden braces in a usual practice and orthodontics, its very unusual for someone to have them.

[Maybe they had an allergy?](https://www.sensu.co.uk/the-benefits-of-gold-braces/#) It could be that they was done in a dental hospital and not a normal practice, if the person had an nickel allergy.","The Addison County trio refers to the mysterious unsolved deaths of three people in Addison County, Vermont, in the early 1930s. The trio consisted of a wealthy mother, Florence Perry, and her two children, Mary and Richard Perry. The trio was found dead in a car that had been driven off a cliff near Middlebury, Vermont.

With all the advancements in technology, I never say never these days. Thanks again.","Ronald Townsend and Brian Schrock were two friends who were murdered on New Year’s Eve in 1977. On the evening of December 31, 1977, the two friends were walking along a road in the town of Oxford, Ohio. At some point during their walk, they were both shot and killed.

The murders remain unsolved to this day. No suspects have been identified and the motive for the killings remains unknown. The only clues that have been uncovered are that the two men were seen arguing with a man in a pickup truck shortly before their deaths.

Investigators believe that the man in the truck may have been the killer or may have information about the crime. Unfortunately, no leads have been found and the case remains open.

The families of the two victims have offered a reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the murders. If you have any information, please contact the Oxford Police Department at 513-523-8100."

Chillicothe also had Tameka Lynch and Shasta Himelrick, who were both found dead in bodies of water. Shasta was pregnant and, IIRC, disappeared on Christmas. 

There is some speculation that presumed serial killer Neal Falls (killed in West Virginia by an intended victim) may have had something to do with one or more of these, but I would say a local origin is probably more likely.",".

The Chillicothe Six refers to the six women who went missing in Chillicothe, Ohio between May 2014 and May 2015. All of the women had drug addiction problems and connections to the sex trade, and their disappearances sparked a nationwide search and investigation. In January 2016, the FBI and local law enforcement declared that the cases were not linked and were not the result of a serial killer. The cases remain unsolved."

In other words, this guy was supposedly carrying around a very large amount of money.",This is a very serious situation. The first step should be to contact the police and report the situation. It is important to provide as much information as possible about the boy and the man who showed up to the family home. The police can then investigate and attempt to locate the boy. The family should also provide the letter to the police as evidence. It is also important to keep in contact with the police in case any new information comes to light.
274,What happened to the Jack family?,"My parents were born in northern BC -- granted, they lived there decades before the Jack family, but unless things had changed a lot, it would have been unusual for child care to be provided at a remote job site. In my folks' time, there might be a lumber mill or a fish cannery, with workers' families living in small cabins (more recently, resource operations don't have the families there, hence the term ""man camps"").   
But unless the arrangement was in the informal sense -- maybe that there were already families up there, and one of the at-home parents had agreed to keep an eye on some extra kids -- the idea of having an actual day care centre up there is a bit unusual.  


That's the only thing that makes me wonder about why the guy would go to such lengths to get the entire family to come up -- instead of suggesting that the parents ask relatives to babysit them while they were away working. It's odd that he wouldn't just move on and ask somebody else. If his operation were that desperate for employees ... I suspect that this wouldn't have been the first time they were doing last-ditch recruitment, and that someone else in that town or nearby would have remembered a similar situation.","The Jack family is a fictional family from the British soap opera EastEnders. The Jack family first appeared on the show in 1985 and was one of the original families. The Jacks were a close-knit family, living in Albert Square, Walford. The family was made up of husband and wife, Den and Angie, and their two children, Sharon and Dennis.

In 1989, Den was killed off the show in a storyline involving the show's villain, Dirty Den. Angie left the show shortly after and the Jack family was split up. Sharon married into the Mitchell family and Dennis moved away from Walford. The Jack family have not been seen on the show since Angie's departure in 1989."

The crew of a tanker reported seeing an explosion and then two fireballs plunge into the sea.",So you’re saying that someone should take a submersible to the ocean floor to search for the plane’s wreckages?,"The cause of the crash remains unknown.

The disappearance of Flight 739 is one of the most mysterious air disasters of all time. The last communication from the pilot indicated that the plane had encountered some sort of turbulence, and when the plane failed to arrive at its destination, an extensive search was conducted. The search, however, yielded no evidence of the plane or its passengers. To this day, the cause of the crash remains a mystery.

Theories about the incident range from a mid-air explosion to a hijacking. Some have speculated that the plane was shot down by the Chinese military, while others believe that the plane encountered an extreme weather event or a technical malfunction. The mystery of Flight 739 has yet to be solved, and it remains one of the greatest unsolved aviation disasters of all time."
276,Could this man (George Dunkley 1877-1945) be connected to John Doe 24?,"The 1940 census shows George Dunkley in the State Hospital in Jacksonville. Maybe something has been mixed up in the story and the hospital gave Lewis some of Dunkley's old clothes.

ETA: Looking the deaf school in 1940, there's a young man with surname Lewis, who's the right age and race. His draft card shows him living in Chicago 1944. I don't immediately see any records for him after that. Ancestry's recommendations have him mixed with a white man of the same name.

Is John Doe's height or weight when he was found available? Is there an agency to contact? This guy looks promising.

[This article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/casey-anthony-update-defense-team-releases-329-page-report-on-expert-witnesses/) says he was an expert witness for the defence in the Casey Anthony trial. He was also involved in that BR Did It JonBenet documentary for CBS.,"Henry Lee, a former forensic scientist, has been found liable by a federal judge for fabricating evidence during the trial of a now-overturned conviction.

The case at hand involved the wrongful conviction of a man named Alfred Swinton, who was charged with murder in the 1990s. Swinton was convicted largely based on evidence that was provided by Lee during his testimony at trial. This evidence included a pair of shoes that Lee claimed belonged to Swinton, and that contained DNA evidence linking him to the crime.

However, it was later revealed that the shoes had been tampered with, and that the DNA evidence had been planted by Lee. This evidence was later found to be false, leading to the overturning of Swinton's conviction in 2003.

In his ruling, the judge found that Lee had acted recklessly and had violated his professional duties as a forensic scientist. The judge also found that Lee had acted with ""gross negligence,"" and had caused Swinton to suffer emotional distress as a result of his wrongful conviction.

The judge ordered Lee to pay Swinton $2.7 million in damages. Lee has since apologized for his actions, and has expressed regret for the harm he caused."
278,Was the 'Microsoft Coffee' prank a hoax?,"I'm not trying to sound like a jerk here, but if this is all true... is it possible that the lack of '90s coverage is because nobody cared when it happened?

It's not like they managed to put dozens of boxes on Walmarts shelves all over the country and tons of people were trying to buy them, or there was a deep message trying to be conveyed. If people in 1996- both journalists and world wide web users- felt the hoax was weak and corny, why would anyone waste time reporting/writing about it?

I MUST stress how fast cruise ships are. People don’t realize it because they seem slow but that’s only because how big they are. If for whatever reason you go overboard, you’re almost 100% fucked especially if no one sees you. Not only are cruise ships huge, and therefore hard to reach someone who fell off, they’re fast and will leave you behind quickly. 


With that being said I do believe Disney is withholding information. Not because of foul play, but Disney REFUSES to have anything negative be attached to their properties. It’s pretty disgusting how low they will go to protect their own image. 

A terrifying way to go. It breaks my heart that in cases like these families rarely ever get closure.

The family of Hannah Rose Walker is understandably frustrated that the investigation into her death has been moved to inactive. It is important for the family to understand that investigations are often complex and can take a long time to resolve, especially when the cause of death is unknown.

The family should contact the detective in charge of the case to discuss the status of the investigation and to determine what steps can be taken to continue to investigate the case. The family can also reach out to community organizations and local media to help draw attention to the case in the hopes of finding new leads or witnesses. Additionally, the family can consider setting up a reward for information leading to a resolution of the case. Finally, the family should contact a wrongful death attorney to discuss their legal options and to explore other avenues to seek justice for Hannah Rose Walker."

284,1981 Homicide of Laura Kempton solved with Forensic Genetic Genealogy,It's great that Lauren Kempton's murder has been solved. It's disappointing when the murderer has passed away and cannot stand trial for crimes.,"In October 1981, the body of 15-year-old Laura Kempton was found in a wooded area near her home in Union Township, New Jersey. She had been raped and strangled. Despite extensive investigation by the Union County Prosecutor’s Office, her murder remained unsolved for nearly four decades.

In 2020, the Union County Prosecutor’s Office’s Cold Case Unit, in collaboration with Parabon NanoLabs, used a cutting-edge technique called forensic genetic genealogy to identify Laura’s killer. Forensic genetic genealogy combines traditional genealogical research with DNA analysis to identify suspects by comparing crime scene DNA to public genealogy databases.

Using this technique, investigators were able to identify a suspect, 76-year-old Richard Schlesinger, who was then charged with murder. In April 2021, Schlesinger pled guilty to the murder and was sentenced to 30 years in prison.

The successful resolution of the case has made Laura Kempton’s murder the first in Union County to be solved using forensic genetic genealogy. The use of this technique has opened up new possibilities for solving cold cases and bringing justice to victims and their families."

When I checked my phone the next morning, nobody had called me at all. My phone hadn’t even been on, and I had absolutely no missed calls in the few days before. 

I probably hallucinated my phone flashing. I was probably awake to some degree, but very realistically saw something that had never been there. 

It was super trippy. I absolutely believe that something like you described could happen.","My theory is that the Cape Intruder was likely a serial offender who was not only targeting people in Cape Elizabeth, but had also committed similar crimes in other areas. This theory is based on the fact that the intruder was never caught, and the fact that similar crimes were reported in other areas during the same time period. It is likely that the intruder had a history of criminal behavior, and was simply looking for new victims in Cape Elizabeth. He may have been targeting vulnerable people who were easy to access, and may have been motivated by a need to feel powerful or in control. It is also possible that he was driven by a more sinister motive, such as sexual gratification or power.

The lack of evidence at the scene made it difficult for investigators to determine what had happened, and the case remains unsolved to this day. In addition to the lack of evidence, the mystery surrounding the crime is heightened by the fact that the family had no known enemies or problems with anyone in the community. This has led to many theories about the crime, including that the family was targeted by a serial killer, that the murders were part of a Satanic ritual, or that the family had been involved in a drug deal gone wrong.

You put a lot of time into this sub and it’s very much appreciated. 

Candice’s story was shared here at least once before (I’ll share a link below), but certainly deserves more attention. 

I feel obligated to share that I knew Candice. We went to the same high school. We had a few classes together and had mutual friends. We weren’t close, but I feel I knew her well enough to say she truly was a lovely soul. I cannot think of her ever being unkind to anyone, nor do I ever recall her being treated unkindly.

303,"Regarding Rebecca Zahau's death, is there anything at all that's genuinely hard-to-explain in the forensic evidence?","I think this is one of those cases that people immediately classify as 'weird' and go into reading about it thinking something is off. If you're already suspicious, I think it's easy to grasp onto odd details and lose sight of the bigger picture.

Personally I think there are a lot of strange facts in this case, but it was a very strange situation *before* Rebecca's death. Her boyfriend's son had been horribly injured in a bizarre accident, Rebecca's sister was visiting and present when the accident happened and then quickly bundled off back home, boyfriend's brother starts staying at the house because of the inured nephew, entire family is understandably massively upset and confused, then she gets word that Max is going to be taken off life support. That's a lot to have happen in a short time frame, and I'm sure Rebecca was also aware that her relationship with her boyfriend probably wouldn't survive his son's death on her watch. 

Yes, it's an odd suicide and we can each come up with some portion of it that 'I would *never*' or 'women don't...' but there are a few details about Rebecca's life that indicate she reacted dramatically to things (I don't quite know how to word that, I'm absolutely not trying to be disrespectful towards her), namely pretending to be kidnapped when one of her prior relationships was ending. A lot of the details people cite as proof it was murder come directly from the Zahau family attorney during the civil lawsuit against the boyfriend's brother, not from facts established in court.

To me it comes down to the fact that there was enough going on in Rebecca's life to seriously unravel even the most stable person, there's no actual evidence of anyone else's involvement, and if it's a weird suicide it's a far stranger fake suicide to cover up a murder.","One thing that has been difficult to explain in the forensic evidence of Rebecca Zahau's death is the presence of a type of adhesive on her wrists and ankles. This adhesive was found to be a type of glue, and its presence remains unexplained. Additionally, the fact that Zahau was found completely naked with her hands and feet bound has been difficult to explain, as there has been no definitive evidence to indicate whether the bindings were self-inflicted or the result of a third party."
304,The Urban Legend Behind The World’s First CPR training mannequin. Who is the unidentified model behind the Unknown of the Seine? Annie Who Are You?,">The Lorenzi date the mask to the 1860s because the hairstyle in fashionable headbands under the Second Empire is in favor of this date.

Inconnue does not wear a headband. Her hairstyle is quite typical for 1850s, with the center part, hair covering the ears and probably pinned up in the back of her head. You can see [Empress Eugenie](https://franzxaverwinterhalter.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/54-winterhalter-eugenie-houston-tx1.jpg) sporting similar hairdo in the portrait by Franz Xavier Winterhalter, from 1854. The coiffures of 1860s were swept more up and back and not as rounded on the sides.","The mystery behind the first CPR training mannequin, the ""Unknown of the Seine,"" has been the subject of much speculation over the years. The mannequin was created in France in the late 19th century by French doctor and physiologist Pierre-Paul Broca, and is believed to be modeled after a real person.

The identity of this person remains unknown, but there is a popular urban legend that the Unknown of the Seine was modeled after a woman named Annie. According to the story, Annie was a prostitute who was found dead in the Seine River in Paris in 1875. Broca, who had a passion for anatomy, was said to have been so moved by her death that he decided to create a mannequin in her likeness and use it to teach the lifesaving technique of CPR.

Whether this story is true or not remains a mystery, but it serves as a reminder of the importance of CPR and the power of medical knowledge to save lives."

I just don't think taking a weird  route is that ""weird""--as you said, no gps, maybe she wasn't particularly good at routing, maybe she stopped at or went random places as they appealed to her.","The story begins with a young woman named Leah Roberts, who is on a road trip with her two closest friends. They are all in a hurry to get to their destination, and Leah is determined to make it there as quickly as possible. As they drive, the car begins to make strange noises and the engine starts to sputter. After a few miles, the car finally comes to a stop in a deserted area.

Leah and her friends get out of the car to investigate, but soon discover that the vehicle has been rigged with explosives. With no other options, they quickly abandon the car and continue on their journey.

Suddenly, Leah notices that one of her friends is missing. She frantically searches for her, but to no avail. After a few hours, Leah and her remaining friend realize that the missing woman must have been kidnapped.

Leah and her friend quickly devise a plan to find the missing woman. They make their way to the nearest town and gather information from the locals, hoping to track down the kidnappers. After a few days of searching, they finally locate the kidnappers and rescue the missing woman.

Kellar had a history of drug use and mental illness, and may have been in a vulnerable state when he left home. It is possible that he may have become a victim of foul play, as no one has been able to locate him since his disappearance.

308,"Thoughts on ""Myth of the Zodiac Killer""","I thought that the killer had provided information that only he would know? 

Having said that, the investigation into the Yorkshire Ripper was seriously derailed by hoax letters and a tape that supposedly contained details only the killer would know. It was later shown all the information could be found in newspaper reports. 

That would require research into the press reports at the time and comparing them to the information in the letters. If it could be shown that nothing in the letters wasn't already reported then this theory might have some merit.

The only exception to this would be someone who had access to the police reports. Not as unlikely as it seems. I read a book about the Monster of Florence. The writer was actually considered a suspect because of the confidential information he knew. In reality he was just paying off a filing clerk who worked for the police.","The ""Myth of the Zodiac Killer"" is an interesting concept as it brings up the idea of a serial killer who has never been identified or caught. It's a mystery that has captivated audiences for decades and has been the subject of numerous books, movies, and TV shows. While there have been theories and suspects, no one has been able to definitively prove the identity of the Zodiac Killer.

They belonged to a cattle rancher who had vanished 3 months prior - seems he got lost or injured, wasn’t entirely unsurprising to those who knew him as he was prone to poor judgement and lapses in memory after suffering a stroke… he was in his 60s and stubbornly refused to retire or take the back seat.

It was good for his village to have closure, as in this case.

(If you’re wondering, my cousin was very much impacted on an emotional level. He was alone when he made the discovery, having gone someway ahead of the students so he could scout out some locations for field work. He was assisting his old PhD supervisor at the time out of UTA.)","The Mohave County Sheriff's Office has identified the deceased as Jordan Victor Carvalho, 20, of Golden Valley, Arizona. Carvalho was found dead on June 3, 2022, near a remote area off of Highway 68 in the White Hills area. The cause of death is still under investigation. Carvalho's family has been notified of his passing."
333,"Where is college student Cindy Song? State College Pennsylvania, November 1, 2001","Eh, I don’t see this as too odd tbh.  Missing two days of classes only stands out if the professors communicate with one another.  And assuming M-W-F or T-Th classes, she only missed one class for each.  That’s well within normal.  I missed whole weeks at times during my senior year and only got a snarky “welcome back.”

Missing a weekend’s worth of social activity could motivate friends to check, and it appears it did, but it wouldn’t necessarily spark panic.","Cindy Song is most likely attending classes at Penn State University in State College, Pennsylvania on November 1, 2001."
334,Boca Raton Mall Murders,"I've never heard of this case.  Thank you for a great write-up.

Seems like a lot of trouble to go through to get $500-600.  Who would risk going to jail for murder for that amount of money?

My first thought as I was beginning to read the post was that this was something personal, and the theft was just to cover it up, a red herring per se.  But then to find out that there was another instance previously  seems to rule out that idea.","The Boca Raton Mall Murders refer to a series of murders that occurred at the Boca Raton Mall in Boca Raton, Florida on April 25, 1987. The murders were carried out by two men, Brian Brown and Craig Godineaux, who had been hired by a third man, Kenneth Wilk, to rob the mall. Wilk had planned to use the money from the robbery to finance his drug habit. During the robbery, Brown and Godineaux shot and killed three people; a mall security guard, a store manager, and a customer. They also wounded four other people. 

The two men were apprehended shortly after the murders and were charged with first-degree murder, armed robbery, and other related charges. They were convicted and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Wilk was also charged with first-degree murder and armed robbery and was sentenced to life in prison. 

The Boca Raton Mall Murders remain one of the most notorious and tragic crimes in the history of South Florida."
335,"Stillwater County [Montana] John Doe (2019) identified as Michael Moler of Midland, Texas",Rip :( Wonder how he got there… I wonder if the US Army takes DNA/ fingerprints of their soldiers/veterans? Im sure that would have made the ID’ing process a lot easier,"In 2019, John Doe was identified as Michael Moler of Midland, Texas. The Stillwater County Sheriff's Office in Montana made the identification after Moler's body was found in a shallow grave in the area. The cause of death was ruled to be a gunshot wound to the head. 

Moler had been missing since October 2018, when he was last seen in Midland. His family had reported him missing and had been searching for him ever since. 

The Stillwater County Sheriff's Office investigated the case and, after months of searching, were able to identify Moler's body. Once identified, the Sheriff's Office was able to notify Moler's family and provide them with closure. 

The investigation into Moler's death is still ongoing, and no suspects have been identified at this time."
336,Litigation and confusion in the year since the theft of millions of dollars worth of jewelry at a Southern California truck stop,"I work in the logistics field and am fairly familiar with 53' trailers (I used to inspect them) and trucker culture. 

I'm curious as to whether the trailer had swing doors or a roll door? Swing doors are pretty quiet to open but you have to open them before pulling a vehicle up to the trailer to load... Roll doors are a lot louder to open but you can pull up flush to the back of the trailer before opening the doors, which makes it easier to unload quickly.

I don't know about the frequency of weigh stations along the interstate in California, but in the Midwest they would have encountered a couple of them within 300 miles, which would make having left at midnight absolutely impossible. I'm a little surprised that a Brinks truck wouldn't have GPS built into the trailer or a camera, since a lot of trailers that haul lower value goods have one or both of those.

From my experience and from anecdote, most seasoned long haul truckers could sleep through a tornado. This is out of necessity since truck stops and the road itself can be pretty noisy and chaotic. A driver not waking up while the trailer was unloaded is not surprising at all... Trucks tend to park close enough to each other that it could just be another driver checking their load.

Also curious as to what time the convention wound down, since most I'm familiar with seem to close closer to 5 or so and both drivers would have been required to load the trailer. I'm wondering if they gave an earlier time for when the second driver went to sleep because they were trying to do math on the spot to cover for the fact that the second driver might have been getting ready to take over on less than 10 hours of rest?

Thank you for this write-up! I wasn't familiar with this story and am super excited to have a case in a field that I'm familiar with!","Since the theft of millions of dollars worth of jewelry at a Southern California truck stop in October 2019, there has been ongoing litigation and confusion surrounding the case. In December 2019, the truck stop's insurance company, Zurich American Insurance Company, filed a lawsuit against the jewelry store owner, alleging that he failed to properly secure the jewelry, failed to report the theft in a timely manner, and failed to cooperate with the investigation. The jewelry store owner then countersued Zurich American, claiming that the insurance company failed to provide adequate coverage for the stolen jewelry. In response, Zurich American filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that the jewelry store owner had failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his allegations. 

In April 2020, the truck stop's insurance company also sued the trucking company that had been transporting the jewelry, alleging that it failed to properly secure the jewelry and failed to report the theft in a timely manner. The trucking company then countersued Zurich American, claiming that the insurance company had failed to provide adequate coverage for the stolen jewelry. The trucking company also argued that the jewelry store owner had failed to properly secure the jewelry and failed to report the theft in a timely manner. 

The case is still ongoing and the outcome remains unclear. As the legal proceedings continue, the confusion and frustration surrounding the case remain high."
337,"Missing, indigenous mother of 4 missing since 2004","I would be curious what friends and family say.  was she dating anyone? did drugs?  did she have stable housing? a stable job that paid well?  was she going out to do something and never returned? did she have a habit of leaving for extended periods of time?  sorry, questions are not helping.  just so little info on something that seems so vexing.  I feel so bad for the kids.  they must be grown now and I bet they must have missed their mom terribly all these years.  then, to not have any info.  I wonder if they could help put together pieces?  I don’t know, I feel like with there being more of a spotlight on missing indigenous women that maybe a little noise could go a long way.","There is no one specific indigenous mother of four missing since 2004 that can be identified due to the lack of available information. However, according to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, there are currently more than 1,000 indigenous individuals who have been reported missing since 2004. These individuals come from tribes across the United States and Canada, and range in age from infants to elders. In addition, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) reports that approximately 16,500 Native American children are reported missing each year."
338,"James Lewis, who claimed responsibility for the 1982 Chicago Tylenol murders, was found dead yesterday.","If you study up on the Tylenol Murders, you will see that the big problem with Lewis as a suspect is that all evidence suggests he was in New York City at the time the contaminated bottles were placed on the drugstore shelves in Chicago.  He would have needed to be in the Chicago area during a specific day and have a car available to make those deliveries when they occurred.  He didn’t own a car at the time and no evidence could be found that he rented a car in either Chicago or New York.  While there might be senecios available that might explain away these issues, they are not probable.  It is quite common for people to attempt to extort from the families of kidnapping victims when they had nothing to do with the actual kidnapping.  That is most likely what happened in this case.  

Some DNA was found on some of the pills in one of the bottles.  It is likely, but not certain, that it belonged to the poisoner.  If that DNA was linked to anyone without an “innocent” reason to have handled those pills it would be highly incriminating.  That DNA has not been linked to Lewis. The lasting interest in Lewis had less to do with any real evidence of his guilt and more to do with the fact that he was pretty much the only suspect.","Lewis was never officially charged with the murders. In 2009, he confessed to the 1982 Chicago Tylenol murders, claiming that he was hired by an unknown third party to commit the crimes. He was found dead in his Chicago apartment on December 6, 2016. The cause of death is unknown."
339,What is your Kyron Horman theory?,"First of all, I don't think Terri did it. She had no time to do so. If she left Skyline at 8:45 (more likely at 8:50, since went up the stairs when the bell rang, said goodbye to Kyron and walked out of the school to the truck), her next hour would be like this:

* 8:50 ca - driving from school
* 9:00 ca (ten minute driving time) - arrives at Fred Meyer at Imbrie Drive, looking for medicine for her daughter but not finding it.
* 9:12 - gets a receipt for coffee at the Starbucks at that same Fred Meyer
* 9:30 ca (10 minute driving time) - arrives at Fred Meyer at Walker Rd, goes into the store, finds medicine, chats with an acquaintance, then drops of a couple of shirts at a dry cleaners
* 10:00 ca - leaves the Fred Meyer, drives to a Michaels craft store (ca 5 minutes away)
* 10:10-10:15 ca - leaves Michaels, gives her daughter the medicine, sits for about half an hour trying to get her to sleep before driving up to highway 30 to let the motion of the car soothe her. 

The last point is the time where Terri can't be verified on CCTV or by witnesses. A phone ping does place her at highway 30, but that's it. However, at 10:00 the school had noted Kyron's absence. So Terri would not be able to get Kyron from the school at any point before he was confirmed as missing. There's also the fact that no one saw Kyron leave with her, and that no one saw Kyron in the truck at any of the Fred Meyers (he wasn't with her in the stores).

No, what I think happened is this. At 8:45 the students were supposed to gather in groups of five or six to tour the exhibits, and it seems to have been a fairly chaotic affair. A classmate saw Kyron in the upstairs hallway shortly after Terri left, and Kyron said he was going to see an electrical exhibit (which a parent said was in another upstairs classroom, in a blog comment). A friend of Kyron's brother then saw Kyron in the gym, with some of his friends, looking at other exhibits. And finally he arrived at downstairs classroom 109. There is a blog that published witness statements from some of the children that they saw Kyron leave that room and go outside with a man who asked for help to bring something from his truck. Right outside 109 was the access road that led to the Skyline boulevard, and where someone saw Kyron with an unknown person by a white truck. The truck was commonly called Terri's truck in the media, but at that point witnesses had been primed to see any white truck they remembered as Terri's.

So, a man, probably not a local, walked into the open to the public school. He roamed the halls, acting like he belonged there (there were children who commented on facebook that there had been a creeper there, so not everyone was fooled), until he found a child that seemed pliable and meek. He lured him out of the school via the access road, took him to his truck parked at the access road (where a chain blocked it from going further in), got Kyron inside the car and drove far, far away. He couldn't know the school would mess up and not notice or report Kyron's absence until much later, but it really wouldn't matter, as he would be in Portland before the cops arrived even if the school reacted immediately.","There is no single Kyron Horman theory, as the case is still unsolved. However, many people believe that Kyron could have been abducted by someone he knew, or that he may have run away. Others believe he may have been taken by a stranger, or that he could have been the victim of a tragic accident."
340,"On August 25, 1973 10 year old Joane Ratclife and 4 years old Kirste Gordon old they went to a football game at the Adelaide oval stadium in Adelaide Australia, during the game they disappeared and have not been seen since.","It's believed to be related to the Beaumont children case a few years prior, so there's a TON of overlap between their potential suspects. 

The description given lines up well with Arthur Stanley Brown, who told an acquaintance he was in the area at the time. He was even identified by a witness years later, when he was on trial for murdering two other young girls. However, there isn't any evidence he was ever in South Australia, though it is believed that work records placing him there were destroyed in a flood in the 70s. On top of that, Brown was a government worker who could've had access to these files, and destroyed them himself.

I think one tragic thing about this case is that it is so heavily overshadowed by the Beaumont children case. It's more often seen as a ""hey, this also happened"" in regards to the more famous abduction as opposed to its own inquiry.","The case remains unsolved to this day. The case has been investigated by both the South Australia Police and the Australian Federal Police. Despite numerous searches and appeals for information, the girls remain missing.

Theories about what happened to the girls abound. Some people believe they were kidnapped, while others suggest they were killed by someone they trusted. Some believe the girls may have simply run away, while others think they may have been taken by a stranger.

The Australian Federal Police have offered a reward of up to $1 million for any information leading to the location of the girls or the conviction of any person responsible for their disappearance.

The case remains one of the most baffling unsolved mysteries in Australia. It serves as a reminder of how quickly a child can disappear and how difficult it can be to locate missing persons."

The suspect was identified through a search of public genealogy databases. Investigators compared the DNA from the crime scene to that of individuals in the database, looking for a match. They eventually identified a suspect, a distant relative of Casper, who was arrested and charged with her murder.

The use of forensic genetic genealogy has revolutionized criminal investigations, allowing investigators to identify suspects in cases that have gone unsolved for decades. In the case of Joyce Casper, it was the first time that this technology had been used to solve a murder in San Antonio."

I can't wait to read the second part.  


And thank you for posting this.","On the morning of December 19th, 1978, the Ann Arbor Veteran’s Hospital in Michigan was rocked by a series of horrific murders. Five people were killed in the rampage, including the director of the hospital, Dr. Robert Stoecker. The victims were all shot multiple times with a .22 caliber handgun. Police quickly began an investigation into the murders, but there were no immediate leads. 

The investigation was hampered by the fact that the hospital had no security system or cameras to record the events of the night. In addition, the hospital had no records of anyone entering or leaving the building the night of the murders. Police began to look into the backgrounds of the victims, but it was a slow and tedious process. 

The police eventually discovered that one of the victims, Dr. Stoecker, had been receiving threatening letters from someone claiming to be a former patient. The letters contained specific details about the hospital and its staff, leading police to believe that the killer was someone with an intimate knowledge of the hospital. 

Police were able to identify a suspect, but they lacked sufficient evidence to make an arrest. After months of investigation, the case went cold and the murders remain unsolved to this day."
350,"MISSING Jian Ping Li 42, and her infant son from Brossard Canada","I guess that the most statistically likely outcome is that the husband did it, given their seemingly difficult relationship (at the time) and him getting into a new relationship so quickly. Still, if he did it, then killing his wife and youngest child would be odd. From what I understand, all of the kids are theirs (in a lot of these cases the partner kills the child that is from a previous relationship), so why would he kill the youngest? 

In cases like these I always wonder, did the person who just ""got up and left"" never said anything, absolutely anything? She had two other kids who could tell if mom mentioned going somewhere. 

Another posibility is some kind of a double suicide caused by post-partum depression or other mental issues. I know that the family said that she was doing well, but you never know what another person is thinking. Foul play is also possible, but there's not enough information to tell for me.

354,which case is your “unrealistic theory”,"This is a case that is very obscure outside of Spain and, at first glance looks very mysterious, but when you take into account the circumstances surrounding the people involved you realize that it's way, way simpler than mystery boards and publications make it look like. So much so, than a PI working for the family has tried to tell them over and over that there's no elaborate scheme. **The 1988 disappearance of the Orrit-Pirés children.**

I've spoken about this case a few times in this subreddit, [here's one of the most recent comments I've made about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/xw4kfg/comment/ir5g725/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) with a (I hope) detailed enough explanation of the case -includes pictures and more info. But in case you don't feel like going to another thread here's a summary;

The night between 4th to 5th September of 1988 in a hospital in Manresa, Catalonia; a 5-year old boy (**Isidro Orrit-Pirés**), who was admitted to the hospital and set to undergo a tonsillectomy in the morning, disappears along his 17-year old sister **(Dolores Orrit-Pirés),** who was staying with him overnight\*\*.\*\* Basically, when the nurses came to Isidro's room at 6AM to wheel him to the surgery room both children were gone, apparently without any trace except for a pair of glases (Dolores was very near sighted, but the glasses were eventually linked to another person). Sniffer dogs traced their scent all the way to the hospital gate, where they ended -which investigators interpreted as the kids getting into a car there.

Over the years there have been lots of speculating narratives regarding human/organ trafficking, serial killers and what not. More recently, a guy called a TV show claiming that he had seen the kids being taken to the hospital basement where, according to him, they were sedated and wheeled in stretchers to some secret room. Interestingly, when he was invited to make a formal statement to authorities, he declined.

Now, here's the most plausible scenario; **they just left**. And this is what the PI claims having found. Their home life was absolutely shitty; **14 siblings, living in welfare at a crappy state-sponsored flat, their parents (father had died from cancer that year) were getting the kids out of school at 13 to put them to work, and wanted to have more children even though they couldn't provide for them properly.** They were half-Portuguese, and their Portuguese aunt was at the time super concerned about the children wellbeing, so much so that she had proposed she'd adopt some of them to ease the economic burden -the mother refused, she was in bad terms with her. Dolores was seen making a call from a payphone the days prior to the disappearance; it's believed she was arranging the escape.

The PI has tried to tell the family over and over that he'd found evidence of them being alive and well outside of Spain (being now adults, they have a right to privacy).

356,"We need to discuss the bizarre case of Amber Aiaz and Melissa Fu--Missing from Irvine, CA since 2019","Im 99% sure it’s the husband in this case. Just b/c he didn’t have a mistress or any other motive to kill them, statistically he is the most likely culprit, AND his story is absolute bat shit.
Someone sprayed him in the face, he passed out, they took his step daughter & waited for his wife to return, kidnapped them both, and then left him notes for days? Was there any evidence of any of that? Notes? Camera footage? Other people’s fingerprints in the home or car? 
He got pissed & killed them. Cleaned up, kept up with her business for a few days while he worked out a (really bad) story, and then went to police,
He’s full of it.","Amber Aiaz and Melissa Fu were two young women who went missing from Irvine, CA in 2019. The case has been baffling investigators ever since, as there have been no leads as to the whereabouts of the two women.

Amber and Melissa were last seen leaving a party at a friend's house in Irvine. They were seen getting into a white sedan that was later identified as belonging to Amber's ex-boyfriend. He was questioned by police, but he denied any knowledge of their whereabouts.

Since then, there have been no further leads in the case. There have been numerous searches of the area, but no evidence has been found. There have also been no sightings of the two women, nor any communication from them.

The case has become increasingly bizarre due to the lack of clues and the fact that the two women have seemingly vanished without a trace. Investigators are still actively searching for the pair, but the case remains unsolved."
357,"The Walton, The Witch, and The Murder","I don’t doubt Charles may have practiced some “witchy” or “weird” peculiar, superstitious country “magick” (magic and spiritualism were very much of the zeitgeist), and though there were doubtless pagan remnants of rituals and beliefs in his village, this was actually modern times, where most people belonged to the CoE and had for ages, could read, and newspapers and trains existed (I have a letter from one of my ancestors from the 1830s in Ormskirk that contains slang and references to memes of the time and the most banal stuff you can imagine; even in boring villages people weren’t all necessarily bumpkins).

My mum’s maternal grandparents (she was born in 1942), were poor and one-generation-removed from being tenant farmers of the Earl of Derby (I still have some of the earl’s fancy horse brasses my great-great-grandfather nicked, and good on him!) and, had they lived in an isolated village rather than in a village on the outskirts of Liverpool, would have been ripe for believing any old shit that was gossiped about in the village, especially if it were a particularly isolated one. Still, in most places that era had passed, even though there were still many people in the country living, like Charles, a quite desperate, hand-to-mouth existence even into the twentieth century (my great grandfather’s great treat was having drippings on toast, and he only rode in a car twice in his life, for example…)

This case has always been intriguing to me, but I’m old enough to have a memory of relatives whose whole world was that which they could travel by foot in a day. This man was killed with the tools he carried. I’m not sure how much we can ascribe that to ritual killing…?","The Walton, The Witch, and The Murder is a mystery novel by British author L.A.

358,Shocking new allegations in case of Houston man reported missing 8 years ago,"I just read another article where a couple different private investigators who initially helped with the search were interviewed. Lots of red flags from the beginning. One PI said that the mom gave them the wrong year of birth, so all the fliers had to be redone. According to the PI, Rudy was actually 18 when he went missing, not 17. The picture the mom gave for the missing fliers was of Rudy when he was 14. Mom said that people would have more empathy if he looked younger. I'm guessing that the mom didn't want any current pics on the fliers because he wasn't actually missing. If anyone saw him outside the house, they wouldn't recognize him as the missing boy because he was 4 years older than what he looked like in the fliers. 

The mom told the PI that Rudy was being held by a trafficker in Mexico. The PI tracked this supposed trafficker down and the woman said that Janie (mom) had called her (apparently trying to get her to go along with the kidnap story), and she told Janie that she didn't want anything to do with her scam. 

Another PI said that Janie had them following fake trafficking leads in various places in the U.S. and Mexico.

There is so much craziness going on here. The mom apparently had dozens of fake FB pages. Some of the fake pages had fake relationships and these fake profiles would comment back and forth with each other. Over the years, the mom (on various fake profiles) would post pics like most people do of meals at restaurants, her arm in a cast and other injuries, appreciation posts for her friends, etc. Reverse image search found that most of these pics were just stolen from elsewhere on the internet, including the pics of her ""friends"" and/or ""boyfriends"".

If what Rudy said is true, I can't believe he was allowed to just leave with his mom. I know he's an adult, but if this abuse has been going on for 8 years, then I hope LE is just getting their ducks in a row before charging mom with something. 

But there is a woman in the Rudy FB group who said that both the mom and Rudy previously worked security at an illegal game room. This woman and her husband either worked there or managed, I can't remember. The mom worked day shift and Rudy worked evening/night. Rudy went by the name ""Gabe"". She said Rudy would always do cocaine in the bathroom which is what led to him being fired. She said the mom was fired for refusing to wear a mask during covid. LOL!!

I'll be keeping a close eye on this one.","In the case of a Houston man who was reported missing 8 years ago, the Harris County Sheriff's Office has released new shocking allegations.

I've always thought Tamra was killed by someone close to the family and her body put in a dumpster. Police searched the landfill but it's possible they missed her.

A couple of women went missing in the following years. Danita Bigeagle went missing in 2007, only a few blocks away. Melanie Geddes went missing in 2005, her remains were later found outside of the city, her murder is unsolved. 

The areas these women went missing from were close to the ""strolls"". I've always thought if Tamra was taken by an outsider, it was possibly by someone driving through the area in search of a vulnerable woman. After seeing Tamra, maybe he decided to take her instead.

I've spoken to someone whose family member was a police officer when Tamra went missing and he thought she was ""traded for drugs"". I don't really believe that theory but the drug culture in this city is scary so who knows.

Despite extensive searches and numerous tips, Tamra has never been found. Her disappearance is considered one of the most heartbreaking unsolved mysteries in Canada.

To commemorate Tamra’s disappearance, her family has started the Tamra Keepness Legacy Society, a non-profit organization founded in 2008 to help prevent the abduction of Indigenous children in Canada. The organization works to raise awareness about the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls and provide support to families affected by this tragedy.

The Tamra Keepness Legacy Society also organizes an annual memorial walk in Regina, which is open to the public. This event serves as a way to honour Tamra’s memory and to raise awareness about the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls in Canada.

363,Your Favorite Historical Mystery,"The Head Of Ennius. 

VERY TLDR: the tomb of Roman general Scipio Africanus was lost for 1700~ years, when it was found and excavated in the 1930’s someone broke into a secret chamber and stole the head of a statue using professional tools. 

So… what’s the mystery? 

Again very TLDR: 

- the secret chamber was unknown to literally everyone, there’s no evidence it existed before someone broke into it using professional tools 

- in the 70’s Italian author Ranuccuio Bandinelli writes a book about Italian antiquity but dies before he finishes it, his close friend and student finishes the book for him but finds a hidden trunk with hand-sketched diagrams from the 1910’s of a very similar tomb with a marked out area that resembles the secret rooms interior almost exactly with no ‘source’ material for these sketches. 

- the 80’s roll around and the re-edition of this book completely remove all mentions of the hand drawn diagrams in favour of a most likely made up story about dock workers. Only copies printed in 1976-1981 feature the original notes. 

- in the 90’s an archaeology professor at the university of Florence writes an article about the excavation and claims that at one point he had valued the head at €1200 but never heard from the stranger who brought it to him again

- in 2020 Mario Torelli (the co-author and student of the original author) dies

- in 2020 after Mario’s death someone on the Sapienza university forum claims that there was a “marble head” encased in Mario’s home when he visited there in 2019. 

- in March of 2021 one of Mario’s children says that they remember a “statue head” being on display in their fathers office but didn’t know what it was or where it went after his death

To this day the head is still missing, but more importantly how did someone have hand drawn notes of an almost 2000 year old sealed room.","My favorite historical mystery is The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco. Set in the 14th century, the novel follows the Franciscan monk William of Baskerville and his novice Adso of Melk as they investigate a series of suspicious deaths at a Benedictine abbey in Northern Italy.

Brewster’s family have been notified of her identity and the investigation is now focusing on the circumstances surrounding her death. The Ottawa Police Service and the Ontario Provincial Police are asking anyone with information about Brewster or her death to come forward.

Brewster’s family have expressed gratitude that her identity has finally been established, after 45 years of uncertainty. They released a statement thanking the police for their hard work and dedication in solving this case.

The whole ransom drama must have been a ploy to buy time till the perps can find safe passage to Israel.,"Bohdan Piasecki was a 15-year-old Polish boy who was found dead in a forest in the village of Wola Ostrowiecka, near the city of Lublin in Poland, in August 1990. His death has been linked to one of the most mysterious unsolved crimes in the Eastern Bloc. 

To this day, the cause of Piasecki's death remains unknown. In the months leading up to his death, several people reported seeing him with a group of men in military uniforms. The police investigated the possibility of a kidnapping but were unable to find any evidence. 

Although the case was never solved, it has been speculated that Piasecki was killed as part of a secret operation by the Soviet Union or the Polish secret police. Some have theorized that the boy was killed in retaliation for his father's anti-communism activism. 

In the decades since Piasecki's death, his family has continued to search for answers. In 2011, they filed a petition with the European Court of Human Rights, claiming that the Polish government had failed to properly investigate the case. The court ultimately decided not to hear the case, citing a lack of evidence.

366,The confusing case of Lisa Michelle Smith. Sole surviour of or first victim of the Santa Rosa hitch hiker murderer?,[removed],"Lisa Michelle Smith was the only known survivor of the Santa Rosa Hitchhiker Murders, which occurred in Sonoma County, California, between 1972 and 1973. She was found naked and beaten in a ditch in November 1973, after being picked up by the serial killer. Smith was the only survivor of the murderer's attacks, and her story is the subject of much debate and speculation.

Some believe that Smith was the first victim of the Santa Rosa Hitchhiker Murders, and that the killer had been stalking her for some time before he attacked her. Others believe that Smith was the sole survivor of the killer's attacks, and that the killer had intended to kill her but was thwarted by a passerby who heard her screams and came to her aid.

Regardless of which theory is true, Smith's story is a tragic one. She suffered severe physical and psychological trauma and has never been able to fully recover from her experience.

369,Sandy Springs Unidentified Newborn - 1414UMGA,"Not sure if your question is rhetorical (and disclaimer obviously killing a child is never OK or excusable) but by way of explanation for why this happens, a few possible reasons why: 

-the baby is the result of rape or incest and to cope the mother is in denial or dissociated from their bodies to the extent they cant accept or even recognize they are pregnant until they give birth. They have none of the typical attachment responses and they want to just “get away” from the reminder of the trauma or they mentally shut down, neglect or smother the baby as a trauma reaction. In that context taking the baby to a safe haven or doing literally anything else would be acknowledging the truth of what happened to them which is too overwhelming and unbearable, they just need it to be over and to distance as much as possible from what happened. 

-the mother is in an abusive situation and the baby is killed by the partner and she’s afraid to go to the police for fear of retaliation, or they’re killed by the mother in course of abuse (eg crying is escalating partner and she smothers them, hurt by partner or drop while breastfeeding -a lot of abusive ppl get controlling around feeding baby-, partner won’t let her leave to get medical care, etc.)

-drugs or serious mental illness is involved, or they are a teen in a highly restrictive/religious household and they panic and don’t know what to do. For example they go to school to try to pretend it didn’t happen and because they’re afraid of their parents reaction they don’t get help caring for baby, or go get high to try to deal with the overwhelming feelings of what just happened (usually substance use also coincides with abuse), and baby dies of exposure or neglect. 

Or if delusional may think they’re “protecting” baby from Satan/evil in the world (while sometimes severely mentally ill people are overall not functioning other times the delusion is more targeted and they’re able to compartmentalize/go about regular life.) 

Again none of these responses are OK or logical, and the majority of trauma survivors/teens/ppl with substance use disorders don’t kill their children. Sometimes people are just messed up and kill their kids out of spite, convenience, etc. 

But assuming most people aren’t just cold-blooded psychopaths ready to kill an infant, these are some of the reasons that could lead an otherwise “normal” person to do something so horrific and not go to safe haven/adoption.","The Sandy Springs Unidentified Newborn, also known as Baby Jane Doe or 1414UMGA, was a newborn baby girl found dead in a wooded area of Sandy Springs, Georgia on April 18, 2014. She was found by a passerby who noticed her body in the woods near a road. She was estimated to be between two and three days old at the time of her death.

The baby was found wearing a onesie and wrapped in a blanket, but she had no identifying markings or information. An autopsy revealed she had been born healthy and that her cause of death was asphyxiation, indicating that she had been smothered by someone.

The Sandy Springs Police Department has been investigating the case since the baby's discovery, but no suspects have been identified. The case remains unsolved.

373,Nights of the werewolf a lost late 1960's Spanish monster movie. Where did these reels go.or could it be Is Nights of The Werewolf the same movie as a later film called Fury Of The Wolfman?,"I love this mystery. Alvarez/Naschy (his onscreen name) was a passionate fan of the classic Universal horror films, and something like the Lon Chaney of Spanish horror films. He briefly worked (as a extra) with Boris Karloff on an American television show, and considered it one of the highlights of his life.

The only source for the existence of this film is Naschy himself. Possibilities that have been tossed around horror fandom include:

* Naschy simply misremembered, and mistook this (non-existent) film for ***The Fury of the Wolfman,*** which was made in 1970 and can be viewed today. It's also possible that ***Nights of the Werewolf*** was scripted, but not filmed, and elements were adapted for the 1970 film. Naschy scripted the latter, and may have written a script for this one. 
* Naschy imaginatively made up the credit for his career, at a time when he only had one horror film on his resume, and wanted to kick start his dream of becoming a horror film star (he did eventually succeed).
* The film was really made. However, there's no evidence for this. No director by the name Rene Govar ever worked in the Spanish film industry (or any other nation's film industry, for that matter). No one else in the Spanish film industry ever confirmed that they worked on the movie.

Film journalists have researched this movie, for any evidence (other than Naschy's recounting) that it was ever made, and have not been able to find anything.

380,The found but lost children of California. Post 2.,"I don’t understand how anyone… especially a child, can just disappear and never be looked for? It’s so sad","The story of the lost children of California is a heartbreaking and complex one. It began in the early 2000s, when the California foster care system was overwhelmed with a large number of children in need of care. During this time, many of the children were placed in group homes and other facilities that were not properly monitored or supervised. As a result, some of these children went missing and were never found.

The situation was so dire that the California state legislature passed a law in 2006, the Missing and Exploited Children’s Act, which created a statewide task force to investigate cases of missing and exploited children. The task force has worked with law enforcement, social services, and other agencies to locate missing children and reunite them with their families.

Despite these efforts, many of the lost children of California remain missing to this day. The task force continues to search for them, hoping to bring these children home and reunite them with their families."

382,West Haven Jane Doe Identified As Missing New York Woman,"Rest in peace, Sally. How sad. I’m glad she’s identified. Since there is no cause of death there’s not necessarily a crime or anything but whatever happened I do hope it was not a terrible or violent death. Thanks for posting.","The remains of a woman discovered in West Haven, Connecticut, in 2018 have been identified as those of a missing New York woman.

The West Haven Police Department announced on Friday that the Jane Doe found on the beach in 2018 has been identified as 51-year-old Yolanda Gonzalez of New York City. Gonzalez had been reported missing in July 2018.

The West Haven Police Department said that DNA testing performed by the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) confirmed the identification.

Gonzalez is believed to have died from natural causes. Her death is not being investigated as a criminal case.

The West Haven Police Department thanked NamUs and the New York City Police Department for their assistance in the case.

The body of the woman was found in August 2018 by a passerby on the beach in West Haven. She was wearing a blue shirt and black pants.

The West Haven Police Department had been working with the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System to identify her since then.

The case of Yolanda Gonzalez is a reminder of the importance of DNA testing in identifying the remains of unidentified individuals. It is also a reminder of the work that law enforcement agencies and organizations like NamUs do in identifying and reuniting families with their missing loved ones."

384,The bizarre murder of Bill and Peggy Stephenson,"The condo they lived in is down the street from me. It was awful. Nothing like this has ever happened in our area. They were just a sweet old couple. I’ve always found the case heartbreaking and weird. Especially since they’ve kept almost everything a secret. But someone has to know something. 

About a year later, their nephew beat a woman in Indiana with a skillet and pepper grinder. Police vetted him and there is no connection but it’s still super strange.","On October 3, 1959, Bill and Peggy Stephenson were brutally murdered in their home in Muskogee, Oklahoma. The couple had been married for almost 30 years and had three children. The murder was particularly gruesome, as both of their throats had been cut and their bodies were found in separate rooms of the house. 

The suspect in the murder was their son, Robert Stephenson, who was only 17 at the time of the incident. Robert was believed to have been motivated by money, as he had recently inherited a large sum of money from his grandfather. 

There were a number of strange details surrounding the murder that made it particularly unusual. Firstly, there were no signs of a break-in at the house, indicating that the killer had a key or was already inside the house when the murder occurred. Secondly, no weapons were found at the scene, leading to speculation that the killer had taken them with them. Lastly, Robert had an alibi for the night of the murder, but it was never verified, leading to suspicion that he may have been involved in the crime. 

The case remains unsolved to this day and the details surrounding the murder remain a mystery."
385,New clues in the St. Louis Jane Doe case.,"I think it's probably too late to put the cork back on it at this point. But I think conclusions might be being jumped to here.

As far as I can tell, an anonymous person posted in RBI2 looking for their sister named Jeanetta Brooks, and people in the comments ran with the possibility of St Louis Jane Doe matching the circumstances of the missing person. I don't know if it's been confirmed that Jeanetta is indeed a missing person, or if the poster is legitimate at all. 

The connection between the demographics and circumstances of the RBI2 post were made by Redditors and sent to police who are now trying to make a connection. But the problem is, now we have a situation of broken telephone where some commenters are claiming they got in touch with the poster and it's a ""false story"" but are also not elaborating. So it's a lot of speculation, a lot of people claiming things and not a lot of confirmed facts just yet. I think the first step will be to confirm the existence of Jeanetta and to establish if she is indeed a missing person. Even if she is not connected to our Doe, if there is a missing person in this case she deserves to be given an investigation. 

I guess we just have to wait and see.","1. An updated facial reconstruction of the St. Louis Jane Doe has been released using the latest forensic techniques.

There's various other mental maladies scattered among the family today (I have general anxiety) but the difference is now we know what's happening and are able to get help.

Now I do not know if this sort of thing is genetic, or how it works, but it's interesting that its all in the same side of the family and this may well just affect our particular group and have nothing to do with Charlie's motives, but if nothing else it's an interesting side note and should be added to the mix.","The exact motive for Charlie Lawson's murder of his family on Christmas Day 1929 remains unknown. It is speculated that Lawson was motivated by a combination of mental illness and financial stress. At the time, Lawson was struggling with unemployment and was unable to provide for his family.

The investigation into their murders was extensive, involving multiple law enforcement agencies and a task force dedicated to the case. Despite the efforts of the investigators, the case went cold and remained unsolved for seventeen years.

The Musalo case was a tragedy for the small community of Roseburg, Oregon. It shook the town to its core and left many residents feeling unsafe and vulnerable. The murders also highlighted the need for improved safety measures and procedures in small communities.

The Musalo case was never solved, but the community never gave up hope. In 2020, new evidence was discovered that led to the arrest of a suspect in the murders. While some closure has been found, there are still many unanswered questions surrounding the case.

The Musalo case is a tragic reminder of the dangers that exist in small communities. It is also a testament to the power of hope and perseverance, and a reminder that justice can sometimes take years to be served."

The Signa murder has been linked to the Monster of Florence due to the similarities in the victims and the way they were killed. In both cases, the victims were couples who had been out on a date before they were killed, and they were both shot with a .22 caliber pistol. Furthermore, the crime scenes were both found with the victims’ clothing and belongings scattered around in a similar manner.

The census taker wrote her age (130) in extra-bold letters and drew a circle around it.

She apparently died on 7 Jan 1906. Ancestry.com lists an obituary for her that was published on 11 Jan 1906 in the Beatrice Weekly Times (Beatrice, Nebraska). According to the information transcribed in Ancestry’s record (I can’t view the original because I don’t have a Newspapers.com subscription) she was born on 14 Nov 1770 in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania.

It has a couple of articles published around 1896-1897 (age listed as 126) that provide the same birthdate, but one suggests that she was born in Virginia rather than Pennsylvania. Another 1893 article states that she was born in Virginia—according to *that* article she was born in 1765. That’s the earliest documentation of her claims that I can find so far, and it’s inconsistent with her claims from a few years later.

2nd edit: I just noticed that there’s a transcription error in Mary McDonald’s 1900 census entry on Ancestry. It looks like she is followed by three much younger women who were chambermaids in the home, and the information about occupation and literacy was mistakenly copied from the next row. It looks like Mary had no occupation and could not read or write.","1. ""Woman in 1904 Claimed to Be 134 Years Old"" - The New York Times, October 9, 1904

410,Which missing person cases have the most haunting details?,"The disappearance of Diamond and Tionda Bradley. 

It is local to me.

Two little girls, sisters, disappeared while their mother was at work. Despite the largest manhunt in Chicago history, despite the assistance of the FBI these little girls vanished into thin air.

Someone has given DNA claiming to be one of the sisters. We will see.

It is very sad.","1. The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann - The most haunting detail of this case is the fact that Madeleine vanished from her family's vacation apartment in Portugal in 2007 while her parents were dining at a nearby restaurant. 

2. The Disappearance of Etan Patz - The haunting detail of this case is that it was the first missing child to have their photo and information printed on a milk carton. 

3. The Disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa - This case is haunted by the fact that the legendary mobster and union leader's body has never been found, despite numerous investigations and theories about his fate. 

4. The Disappearance of Kyron Horman - The haunting detail of this case is that the 7-year-old boy vanished from his Oregon school in 2010 and has never been found. 

5. The Disappearance of Natalee Holloway - This case is haunting due to the fact that the 18-year-old American woman vanished while on a high school graduation trip to Aruba in 2005 and has never been found."
411,"Murder of Charles Joseph Reynolds - December 21, 2022 - Silver Spring, Maryland","Crime increases around the holidays. Particularly robbery and theft. Likely it was a stick up and something went wrong, he fought back or the robber got jumpy. Maybe they were just a cold blooded killer, but that’s not too common. Either way, it sounds like he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. 

The fact that his personal possessions were still on him doesn’t say too much. I don’t know this for a fact, but I bet there is a high probability that when a robbery goes south and a gun goes off/someone gets shot the perpetrator is far more likely to immediately flee *without* taking whatever they were initially trying to get.","Charles Joseph Reynolds, a 55-year-old man from Silver Spring, Maryland was found brutally murdered in his home on December 21, 2022. Reynolds had been stabbed multiple times in the chest and abdomen and his throat had been slashed. A bloody kitchen knife was found at the scene and police quickly identified the weapon as the murder weapon.

Investigators determined that Reynolds had been killed in a robbery gone wrong. It appears that Reynolds had been targeted by a group of robbers, but during the robbery, something went wrong and Reynolds was stabbed multiple times. The robbers then fled the scene, leaving Reynolds to die in his own home. 

Reynolds' murder sent shockwaves throughout the small community of Silver Spring, as it was one of the most brutal murders in the area in recent memory. Police launched an extensive investigation into the murder, but to date, no suspects have been identified or arrested. 

Reynolds' family and friends were devastated by the news of his death. They described him as a kind, gentle, and loving man who was loved by all who knew him. They are still searching for answers and justice for his death."

413,Adnan Syed and family of Hae Min Lee Back in Court Again Yesterday,This is one of those situations where based on everything I’ve read I think he probably did do it but there wasn’t enough evidence and rather than build their case properly the state violated Brady and lied. At that point it would be incredibly wrong to continue to hold him in prison. I imagine he wins at the new trial. This is what happens when the state takes shortcuts or forces something that isn’t there. People should direct their anger towards the state that screwed up the case and what circumstantial evidence they did have. If he is truly innocent then it makes it sting even more but even if he is guilty the court proceedings HAVE to go right. If we arrive at the correct conclusion ILLEGALLY then it taints the veracity of the conclusion.,"Yesterday, Adnan Syed and his family of Hae Min Lee were back in court once again, this time for a hearing on a motion to re-open the case. Syed is currently serving a life sentence for the 1999 murder of his ex-girlfriend, Hae Min Lee. Syed's lawyers argue that he was wrongfully convicted and that new evidence that has come to light should be considered in a new trial. The motion hearing was held yesterday in Baltimore City Circuit Court and was presided over by Judge Martin Welch. The hearing lasted several hours and was attended by both Syed's family and Lee's family. While the outcome of the hearing is not yet known, the judge is expected to make a ruling on the motion in the coming weeks."

417,Mystery of the Australian Titanic. What happened to the SS Waratah?,"You've left out a tantalising detail about the passenger who felt the ship was ""top heavy"" and was so spooked he left the voyage in Durban. Best decision of his life.","The SS Waratah was a British passenger liner that disappeared off the coast of South Africa in 1909.

418,Update on the thirty-four-year-old case. DNA identified the murderer of Olya Sazonova in Ulyanovsk,"Very detailed, thank you. Poor little girl! I hope that maniac didn't hurt anyone else, because he was on the loose for so long...",", Russia, in 1985.

The suspect, Viktor Kondratyev, was arrested on April 2, 2019, in connection with the 1985 murder of Olya Sazonova. Kondratyev, who was a teenager at the time of the murder, was identified through a DNA match which police obtained from a sample taken in 2018.

Kondratyev, now 58, has been charged with premeditated murder and is currently awaiting trial in Ulyanovsk. If convicted, he could face up to life in prison.

The case has been a source of fascination in Russia for the past 34 years. Olya Sazonova was a 17-year-old schoolgirl whose body was found in a forest outside of Ulyanovsk. Although investigators initially believed that she had been killed by a stranger, a lack of evidence meant that the case remained unsolved for decades.

The breakthrough came in 2018 when police were able to obtain a DNA sample from the crime scene. This sample was then matched to Kondratyev, leading to his arrest.

The case has been a major success for the Ulyanovsk police department, who have been working tirelessly to find Sazonova’s killer for the past 34 years. The arrest of Kondratyev finally brings closure to the family of Olya Sazonova and to the people of Ulyanovsk."
419,Nogales John Doe Identified As Missing Man,"If his fingerprints matched initially, I wonder why that was deemed insufficient for confirming his identity. It seems strange.","The Nogales John Doe, a man whose body was discovered in a shallow grave in Nogales, Arizona in 2013, has been identified as a missing man from Mexico.

He seems like a good candidate but he was also disabled and used a cane.

Regardless, a very sad case and I hope they get their name back someday. Thank you for putting a spotlight on this case.","Los Angeles Doe was an unidentified female whose body was found in Los Angeles, California on August 12, 1986.
