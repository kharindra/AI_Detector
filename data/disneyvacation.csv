So there won't be content, just spam...","Reddit has been the source of much consternation for third-party application developers over the past few years. This is largely due to Reddit's decision to no longer allow developers to make use of its API and other data in order to create applications that interact with the site. This has had a particularly negative impact on developers who had created popular third-party applications that allowed users to access Reddit content in a more streamlined, user-friendly way.

The decision to block access to the API and other data has been a major blow for many developers, and it has caused many of the popular third-party applications to shut down. This has left Reddit users with fewer options for accessing the site's content, and has also caused some to question whether Reddit is actually killing itself by cutting off third-party developers.

Reddit has responded by stating that it is merely trying to protect its users from malicious actors, but many developers and users are still unhappy with the decision.

At the end of the day, it's hard to say whether Reddit is killing itself or not, but the decision to block access to its API and other data has certainly had a negative impact on third-party developers and users alike."
