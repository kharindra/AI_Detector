"Great points. However, I would want add a cautionary note on the guarded optimism about plateauing of carbon emissions and gradual decline.

Frist, global warming is mostly determined not by how much we emit but by how much stays in the atmosphere. About 50% of what we emit is absorbed by oceans and land ecosystems, and only 50% stays in the atmosphere. But these natural sinks are degrading and will absorb less CO2 than in the past, so a larger fraction of our emissions will stay in the atmosphere. This means we might still continue with the same level of global warming even with less emissions.

Second, how much we emit depends on how we measure. Given that the issue of emissions has become geopolitical with economic and commercial implications, all countries have incentives to under report emissions by choosing smaller emission factors of fossil fuels or overreport sink capacity, by showing larger forest area etc. Everyone can play with numbers and do some accounting tricks to meet their climate pledges without making significant reduction in emissions.


Therefore, I think the true measure of progress is theu concentration of atmospheric CO2, which is increasing. Check the website co2.earth. Despite plateauing.of our carbon emissions, atmospheric CO2 is increasing by 2.2 ppm per year, which was about 2 ppm a few years ago. This means either our sinks are degrading or we are doing accounting tricks to undercount our emissions, or both.

Remember: nature and the laws of climate physics dont care about politics and accounting. Our climate is governed by absolute emissions that stay in the atmosphere not by what we think we are emitting.",0
"Abstract:
>Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, produces rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. However, owing to the undesirable adverse effects of ketamine, there is an urgent need for developing safer and more effective prophylactic and therapeutic interventions for depression. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) mediates the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine. The steroidal alkaloid tomatidine and its glycoside α-tomatine (tomatine) can activate mTORC1 signaling in peripheral tissues/cells. We examined whether tomatidine and tomatine exerted prophylactic and therapeutic antidepressant-like actions via mPFC mTORC1 activation using a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depression. Male mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered tomatidine/tomatine before and after the LPS challenge to test their prophylactic and therapeutic effects, respectively. LPS-induced depression-like behaviors in the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swim test (FST) were significantly reversed by prophylactic and therapeutic tomatidine/tomatine administration. LPS-induced anhedonia in the female urine sniffing test was reversed by prophylactic, but not therapeutic, injection of tomatidine, and by prophylactic and therapeutic administration of tomatine. Intra-mPFC infusion of rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor, blocked the prophylactic and therapeutic antidepressant-like effects of tomatidine/tomatine in TST and FST. Moreover, both tomatidine and tomatine produced antidepressant-like effects in ovariectomized female mice, a model of menopause-associated depression. These results indicate that tomatidine and tomatine exert prophylactic and therapeutic antidepressant-like effects via mTORC1 activation in the mPFC and suggest these compounds as promising candidates for novel prophylactic and therapeutic agents for depression.",0

Abstract:

**Objective**

This study aimed to assess the long-term effectiveness and seizure recurrence risk in children with drug-resistant epilepsy who achieved seizure freedom on a ketogenic diet (KD). Predictors associated with seizure recurrence were also evaluated.

**Methods**

Patients with drug-resistant epilepsy who received KD therapy for at least three months between May 2011 and April 2020 were included. The clinical efficacy of the KD was evaluated. Patients who achieved seizure freedom for at least three months on the KD were focused. Multivariate Cox regression models were used to explore the risk factors of seizure relapse in patients who achieved seizure freedom.

**Results**

This study included 288 patients (163 males, 125 females). The seizure-free rates of the KD at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months were 9.7%, 16.7%, 14.2%, and 9.0%, respectively. Additionally, the seizure reduction rates between 50% and 99% were 46.5%, 39.9%, 30.2%, and 20.5%, respectively. Patients with Angelman syndrome (AS) showed the highest efficacy rate, followed by those with Dravet syndrome (DS). Fifty-one patients achieved at least three months of seizure freedom on the KD. Seizures recurred in 24 (47.1%) patients. None of the patients with AS relapsed, while those with DS had the highest recurrence rate. The etiology of epilepsy, KD maintenance treatment period, and electroencephalography (EEG) abnormalities during follow-up differed significantly between patients with and without recurrence. However, multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that a KD maintenance treatment period of less than 12 months and the presence of EEG abnormalities during follow-up were significantly correlated with a higher risk of relapse. Epilepsy control was restored in 3 of the 24 (12.5%) patients who experienced relapse.

**Significance**

KD appears to be effective in children with various types of drug-resistant epilepsy. A short KD maintenance treatment period and EEG abnormalities during follow-up were associated with an increased risk of seizure recurrence.",0

"Canopy area and biomass are only two components of forest biodiversity and the overall health of the ecosystem. Emphazing these two components as a measure of ecosystem health is analogous to using only GDP for sustainable development. For example, one cannot simply replace all ants, having biomass equivalent to say an elephant, with the elephant and still call it the same ecosystem. Since both, ants and elephants, play different and unique functions, they are not substitutable.

This approach may be suitable for replanting logged forest which has already been replanted once because the damage has already been done once.

However, one should be careful with such findings in the context of logging old growth, virgin forests. I highly doubt that any human intervention can restore ""quickly"" the biodiversity of naturally grown forests.

>The immunomodulatory effects of ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation in human diseases have been described. Whether type 2 lung inflammation is directly affected by solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation is not fully understood. Here, we show a possible negative correlation between solar UVB radiation and asthmatic inflammation in humans and mice. UVB exposure to the eyes induces hypothalamus-pituitary activation and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) accumulation in the serum to suppress allergic airway inflammation by targeting group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) through the MC5R receptor in mice. The α-MSH/MC5R interaction limits ILC2 function through attenuation of JAK/STAT and NF-κB signaling. Consistently, we observe that the plasma α-MSH concentration is negatively correlated with the number and function of ILC2s in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with asthma. We provide insights into how solar UVB radiation-driven neuroendocrine α-MSH restricts ILC2-mediated lung inflammation and offer a possible strategy for controlling allergic diseases.",0

"Abstract:
>Understanding the mechanisms of geroprotective interventions is central to aging research. We compare four prominent interventions: senolysis, caloric restriction, in vivo partial reprogramming, and heterochronic parabiosis. Using published mice transcriptomic data, we juxtapose these interventions against normal aging. We find a gene expression program common to all four interventions, in which inflammation is reduced and several metabolic processes, especially fatty acid metabolism, are increased. Normal aging exhibits the inverse of this signature across multiple organs and tissues. A similar inverse signature arises in three chronic inflammation disease models in a non-aging context, suggesting that the shift in metabolism occurs downstream of inflammation. Chronic inflammation is also shown to accelerate transcriptomic age. We conclude that a core mechanism of geroprotective interventions acts through the reduction of inflammation with downstream effects that restore fatty acid metabolism. This supports the notion of directly targeting genes associated with these pathways to mitigate age-related deterioration.",0

"Abstract:
>Circadian rhythms govern glucose homeostasis, and their dysregulation leads to complex metabolic diseases. Gut microbes exhibit diurnal rhythms that influence host circadian networks and metabolic processes, yet underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we showed hierarchical, bidirectional communication among the liver circadian clock, gut microbes, and glucose homeostasis in mice. To assess this relationship, we utilized mice with liver-specific deletion of the core circadian clock gene Bmal1 via Albumin-cre maintained in either conventional or germ-free housing conditions. The liver clock, but not the forebrain clock, required gut microbes to drive glucose clearance and gluconeogenesis. Liver clock dysfunctionality expanded proportions and abundances of oscillating microbial features by 2-fold relative to that in controls. The liver clock was the primary driver of differential and rhythmic hepatic expression of glucose and fatty acid metabolic pathways. Absent the liver clock, gut microbes provided secondary cues that dampened these rhythms, resulting in reduced lipid fuel utilization relative to carbohydrates. All together, the liver clock transduced signals from gut microbes that were necessary for regulating glucose and lipid metabolism and meeting energy demands over 24 hours.",0
"Abstract  
Coarse-grained materials are widely accepted to display the highest strain hardening and the best tensile ductility. We experimentally report an attractive strain hardening rate throughout the deformation stage at 77 kelvin in a stable single-phase alloy with gradient dislocation cells, that even surpasses coarse-grained counterparts. Contrary to conventional understanding, the exceptional strain hardening arises from a distinctive dynamic structural refinement mechanism facilitated by the emission and motion of massive multi-orientational tiny stacking faults (planar defects), which are fundamentally distinct from the traditional linear dislocation mediated deformation. The dominance of atomic-scale planar deformation faulting in plastic deformation introduces a different approach for strengthening and hardening metallic materials, offering promising properties and potential applications.",0
"**Highlights**

•Seasonal light impacts energy metabolism by modulating the timing of eating

•Photoperiod affects the rhythmicity of fasting-associated metabolites

•Photoperiod alters the phase of core clock transcripts in peripheral tissues

•These effects are largely independent of a functioning melatonergic system

**Summary**

Except for latitudes close to the equator, seasonal variation in light hours can change dramatically between summer and winter. Yet investigations into the interplay between energy metabolism and circadian rhythms typically use a 12 h light:12 h dark photoperiod corresponding to the light duration at the equator. We hypothesized that altering the seasonal photoperiod affects both the rhythmicity of peripheral tissue clocks and energy homeostasis. Mice were housed at photoperiods representing either light hours in summer, winter, or the equinox. Mice housed at a winter photoperiod exhibited an increase in the amplitude of rhythmic lipid metabolism and a modest reduction in fat mass and liver triglyceride content. Comparing melatonin-proficient and -deficient mice, the effect of seasonal light on energy metabolism was largely driven by differences in the rhythmicity of food intake and not melatonin. Together, these data indicate that seasonal light impacts energy metabolism by modulating the timing of eating.",0

>Lipids can be of endogenous or exogenous origin and affect diverse biological functions, including cell membrane maintenance, energy management and cellular signalling. Here, we report >800 lipid species, many of which are associated with health-to-disease transitions in diabetes, ageing and inflammation, as well as cytokine–lipidome networks. We performed comprehensive longitudinal lipidomic profiling and analysed >1,500 plasma samples from 112 participants followed for up to 9 years (average 3.2 years) to define the distinct physiological roles of complex lipid subclasses, including large and small triacylglycerols, ester- and ether-linked phosphatidylethanolamines, lysophosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylethanolamines, cholesterol esters and ceramides. Our findings reveal dynamic changes in the plasma lipidome during respiratory viral infection, insulin resistance and ageing, suggesting that lipids may have roles in immune homoeostasis and inflammation regulation. Individuals with insulin resistance exhibit disturbed immune homoeostasis, altered associations between lipids and clinical markers, and accelerated changes in specific lipid subclasses during ageing. Our dataset based on longitudinal deep lipidome profiling offers insights into personalized ageing, metabolic health and inflammation, potentially guiding future monitoring and intervention strategies.",0

Abstract:
>Exercise is a major beneficial contributor to muscle metabolism, and health benefits acquired by exercise are a result of molecular shifts occurring across multiple molecular layers (i.e., epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome). Identifying robust, across-molecular level targets associated with exercise response, at both group and individual levels, is paramount to develop health guidelines and targeted health interventions. Sixteen, apparently healthy, moderately trained (VO2 max = 51.0 ± 10.6 mL min−1 kg−1) males (age range = 18–45 years) from the Gene SMART (Skeletal Muscle Adaptive Responses to Training) study completed a longitudinal study composed of 12-week high-intensity interval training (HIIT) intervention. Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were collected at baseline and after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of HIIT. DNA methylation (~850 CpG sites) and proteomic (~3000 proteins) analyses were conducted at all time points. Mixed models were applied to estimate group and individual changes, and methylome and proteome integration was conducted using a holistic multilevel approach with the mixOmics package. A total of 461 proteins significantly changed over time (at 4, 8, and 12 weeks), whilst methylome overall shifted with training only one differentially methylated position (DMP) was significant (adj.p-value < .05). K-means analysis revealed cumulative protein changes by clusters of proteins that presented similar changes over time. Individual responses to training were observed in 101 proteins. Seven proteins had large effect-sizes >0.5, among them are two novel exercise-related proteins, LYRM7 and EPN1. Integration analysis showed bidirectional relationships between the methylome and proteome. We showed a significant influence of HIIT on the epigenome and more so on the proteome in human muscle, and uncovered groups of proteins clustering according to similar patterns across the exercise intervention. Individual responses to exercise were observed in the proteome with novel mitochondrial and metabolic proteins consistently changed across individuals. Future work is required to elucidate the role of these proteins in response to exercise.",0

"As misinformation flourished online during the Covid-19 pandemic, a number of platforms announced policies and practices aimed at combating the spread of misinformation. Did those efforts work?

New research published today in Science Advances suggests that the Covid-19 vaccine misinformation policies of Facebook, the world’s largest social media platform, were not effective in combating misinformation. The study, led by researchers at the George Washington University, found that Facebook’s efforts were undermined by the core design features of the platform itself.

“There is significant attention given to social media platforms and artificial intelligence governance today. However, this discussion largely focuses on either content or algorithms. To effectively tackle misinformation and other online harms, we need to move beyond content and algorithms to also focus on design and architecture,” says David Broniatowski, lead study author and an associate professor of engineering management and systems engineering at GW. “Our results show that removing content or changing algorithms can be ineffective if it doesn't change what the platform is designed to do – enabling community members to connect over common interests – in this case, vaccine hesitancy – and find information that they are motivated to seek out.”

To what extent do aesthetic experiences arise from the human ability to perceive and extract meaning from visual features? Ordinary scenes, such as a beach sunset, can elicit a sense of beauty in most observers. Although it appears that aesthetic responses can be shared among humans, little is known about the cognitive mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon. We developed a contour model of aesthetics that assigns values to visual properties in scenes, allowing us to predict aesthetic responses in adults from around the world. Through a series of experiments, we manipulate contours to increase or decrease aesthetic value while preserving scene semantic identity. Contour manipulations directly shift subjective aesthetic judgments. This provides the first experimental evidence for a causal relationship between contour properties and aesthetic valuation. Our findings support the notion that visual regularities underlie the human capacity to derive pleasure from visual information.",0

Abstract  
Medical artificial intelligence (AI) offers great potential for recognizing signs of health conditions in retinal images and expediting the diagnosis of eye diseases and systemic disorders1. However, the development of AI models requires substantial annotation and models are usually task-specific with limited generalizability to different clinical applications2. Here, we present RETFound, a foundation model for retinal images that learns generalizable representations from unlabelled retinal images and provides a basis for label-efficient model adaptation in several applications. Specifically, RETFound is trained on 1.6 million unlabelled retinal images by means of self-supervised learning and then adapted to disease detection tasks with explicit labels. We show that adapted RETFound consistently outperforms several comparison models in the diagnosis and prognosis of sight-threatening eye diseases, as well as incident prediction of complex systemic disorders such as heart failure and myocardial infarction with fewer labelled data. RETFound provides a generalizable solution to improve model performance and alleviate the annotation workload of experts to enable broad clinical AI applications from retinal imaging.",0

"Abstract:
>Vitamin B6 is a vital micronutrient across cell types and tissues, and dysregulated B6 levels contribute to human disease. Despite its importance, how B6 vitamer levels are regulated is not well understood. Here, we provide evidence that B6 dynamics are rapidly tuned by precise compartmentation of pyridoxal kinase (PDXK), the rate-limiting B6 enzyme. We show that canonical Wnt rapidly led to the accumulation of inactive B6 by shunting cytosolic PDXK into lysosomes. PDXK was modified with methyl-arginine Degron (MrDegron), a protein tag for lysosomes, which enabled delivery via microautophagy. Hyperactive lysosomes resulted in the continuous degradation of PDXK and B6 deficiency that promoted proliferation in Wnt-driven colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Pharmacological or genetic disruption of the coordinated MrDegron proteolytic pathway was sufficient to reduce CRC survival in cells and organoid models. In sum, this work contributes to the repertoire of micronutrient-regulated processes that enable cancer cell growth and provides insight into the functional impact of B6 deficiencies for survival.",0

"Abstract:
>Conventional measurements of fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels investigated in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) cannot capture the effects of DNA variability on ‘around the clock’ glucoregulatory processes. Here we show that GWAS meta-analysis of glucose measurements under nonstandardized conditions (random glucose (RG)) in 476,326 individuals of diverse ancestries and without diabetes enables locus discovery and innovative pathophysiological observations. We discovered 120 RG loci represented by 150 distinct signals, including 13 with sex-dimorphic effects, two cross-ancestry and seven rare frequency signals. Of these, 44 loci are new for glycemic traits. Regulatory, glycosylation and metagenomic annotations highlight ileum and colon tissues, indicating an underappreciated role of the gastrointestinal tract in controlling blood glucose. Functional follow-up and molecular dynamics simulations of lower frequency coding variants in glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R), a type 2 diabetes treatment target, reveal that optimal selection of GLP-1R agonist therapy will benefit from tailored genetic stratification. We also provide evidence from Mendelian randomization that lung function is modulated by blood glucose and that pulmonary dysfunction is a diabetes complication. Our investigation yields new insights into the biology of glucose regulation, diabetes complications and pathways for treatment stratification.",0

Abstract  
Visual working memory (VWM) is limited in capacity, though memorizing meaningful objects may refine this limitation. However, meaningful and meaningless stimuli typically differ perceptually, and objects’ associations with meaning are usually already established outside the laboratory, potentially confounding experimental findings. Here, in two experiments with young adults (N = 45 and N = 20), we controlled for these influences by having observers actively learn associations of (for them) initially meaningless stimuli: Chinese characters, half of which were consistently paired with pictures of animals or everyday objects in a learning phase. This phase was preceded and followed by a (pre- and postlearning) change-detection task to assess VWM performance. The results revealed that short-term retention was enhanced after learning, particularly for meaning-associated characters, although participants did not quite reach the accuracy level attained by native Chinese observers (young adults, N = 20). These results thus provide direct experimental evidence that participants’ VWM of objects is boosted by them having acquired a long-term-memory association with meaning.",0

Rural speakers are more likely to have heavy accents and speak in a more local dialect than urban speakers. I think this because of greater mobility, education, and mass media.",0

"Abstract: Drought monitoring is critical for managing agriculture and water resources and for triggering state emergency response plans and hazard mitigation activities. Fixed thresholds serve as guidelines for the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM). However, fixed drought thresholds (i.e., using the same threshold in all seasons and climate regions) may not properly reflect local conditions and impacts. Therefore, this study develops impacts-based drought thresholds that are appropriate for drought monitoring in Ohio. We examined four drought indices that are currently used by the state of Ohio: standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), Palmer’s Z index, and Palmer hydrological drought index (PHDI). Streamflow and corn yield are used as indicators of hydrological and agricultural drought impacts, respectively. Our results show that fixed thresholds tend to indicate milder drought conditions in Ohio, while the proposed impacts-based drought thresholds are more sensitive to exceptional drought (D4) conditions. The area percentage of D4 based on impacts-based drought thresholds is more strongly correlated with corn yield and streamflow. This study provides a methodology for developing local impacts-based drought thresholds that can be applied to other regions where long-term drought impact records exist to provide regionally representative depictions of conditions and improve drought monitoring.",0

"From the article: A [review](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-023-00472-3) of almost 1000 studies on the effects of climate change and extreme weather events on rivers around the world has found an overall negative effect on water quality in rivers globally.

An international team of experts, including scientists from the University of Adelaide and led by Utrecht University in the Netherlands, reviewed 965 studies, sourced from every continent, conducted between 2000-2022.

Multidecadal climate change was shown to have increased water temperatures and algae levels in 56 per cent of studies, which is partly responsible for a general decrease in dissolved oxygen concentrations in river water.

The review also found droughts and heatwaves led to increased salinity and higher concentrations of pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals.

“The severe effects climate change is already having on water quality globally are very concerning. Previous climate change predictions flagged this, but unfortunately, we are now seeing these extreme events play out across the world,” said Associate Professor Luke Mosley, who participated in the research.

“Rivers are intrinsically important ecosystems but also provide key water sources for drinking water and agriculture. Poor quality water can result in the river water being unsuitable for these uses.”",0
"TLDR: 

This is really exciting, groundbreaking stuff. In addition to this material holding incredible magnetic properties, it is unique in that it is made of non-rare earth materials. 

“But much work remains. The material was difficult to make and the team is now trying to optimize the preparation process and continue improving the material’s effectiveness. They are also seeking collaborators who work in quantum computing.”",0
"Summary  
In this experiment, researchers used a particle accelerator known as a cyclotron at the Cyclotron Institute at Texas A&M University to produce a beam of radioactive nuclei at high energies (approximately 10% the speed of light). They sent this beam of radioactive material, oxygen-13, into a piece of equipment known as the Texas Active Target Time Projection Chamber (TexAT TPC). The material stops inside this detector, which is filled with carbon dioxide gas, and decays after about ten milliseconds by emitting a positron and a neutrino (beta-plus decay). By implanting the oxygen-13 into the detector one nucleus at a time and waiting for it to decay, the researchers measured any particles that boil off following the beta-decay using the TexAT TPC. Next, they analyzed the data with a computer program to identify the tracks the particles leave in the gas. This allowed them to identify the rare events (occurring only once per 1,200 decays) as those where four of the particles are emitted following beta-decay.",0

"However, approximately half of the participants displayed poor psychological well-being, as indicated by the Scales of Psychological Well-being. Additionally, despite their relatively short gaming sessions, the participants had poor sleep quality. The researchers explained that this might be due to factors such as prioritizing gaming over sleep, exposure to screen light, mental health issues, dietary habits, and physical activity.

A significant proportion of participants (60.4%) reported drinking coffee, with some consuming up to four cups daily. Given the substantial caffeine intake, the timing of caffeine consumption could be a significant factor affecting sleep patterns.

These findings suggest a need for further investigation into the complex relationships between gaming, lifestyle choices, and mental health among highly engaged gamers.

I grew up in a rural environment and while I understand that a small subset of rural folks are active laborers who are in ""good shape"" because of their work, that is a *small subset*. Objectively speaking, ""a lot of us are in pretty good shape because we are so active"" is just... not true. *A lot* of rural labor is driving things from one place to another, and that is the same ""work"" a city-dwelling office worker is doing. 

There are a lot of studies that show negative health correlations associated with rural living (urban too, for that matter, just different factors), and I think the stereotypical perception of a rural person as a ""lean, agrarian, living off the land"" hasn't been true for a long, long time.

"Abstract

Many organizations use affirmative action to increase diversity in their workforce. Although these programmes are well intentioned, previous research suggests there may be negative consequences that undermine or reduce their benefits. This three-level meta-analysis investigates responses to affirmative action by integrating 437 effect sizes from 78 studies. 

**The results show that affirmative action elicits small to moderate negative effects. These negative reactions are moderated by three key factors: (1) the age of the study, with negative effects diminished in more recent studies; (2) the strength of affirmative action, with policies that provide more preferential treatment to their recipients regarded more negatively and (3) the outcome being measured, with judgments regarding fairness showing the largest negative effects.** 

Notably, behavioural and intrapersonal outcomes, as well as tiebreak affirmative-action policies, do not appear to result in negative reactions. Although beneficiary status did not moderate the effect, subgroup analyses suggest that responses of non-beneficiaries were more unfavourable than those of beneficiaries. Analysis of possible publication bias and study quality suggest acceptable evidentiary value of the overall effect.

Finally, the meta-analysis identifies important gaps that need to be addressed in future research to inform and optimize diversity, equity and inclusion policies and practices.",0

"Life-threatening periods of high heat and humidity will spread rapidly across the world with only a small increase in global temperatures, a study has found, which could cause a sharp acceleration in the number of deaths resulting from the climate crisis.

The extremes, which can be fatal to healthy people within six hours, could affect hundreds of millions of people unused to such conditions. As a result, heat deaths could rise quickly unless serious efforts to prepare populations were undertaken urgently, the researcher said.

Normally, the human body cools itself by producing sweat, which evaporates and takes heat away. But when humidity is high, evaporation is reduced. The study used a limit based on experiments on people showing that when combined heat and humidity, as measured by so-called wet bulb temperature, passes 31.5C, the body is no longer able to cool itself.

"**Abstract**While music listening on mobile phones can serve many affect-regulatory goals, success in reaching these goals is yet to be empirically assessed. This study aimed to determine how frequently listeners successfully reach their affect-regulatory goals, and the predictors of this success. Data were collected using the experience sampling app MuPsych, from 293 Finnish participants. Goals were successfully reached in less than half of cases, with adults more successful than adolescents. Success was determined largely within contexts, and strongly predicted by an initial low-valenced emotional state of the listener, suggesting that music listening is particularly useful for those in negative states.

"> The experiments revealed that the oxidation of a natural mixture of isoprene, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in pure air produces a large variety of organic compounds– so-called ULVOCs (Ultra-Low-Volatility Organic Compounds). As the name suggests, these are not very volatile and therefore form particles very efficiently, which can grow over time to become condensation nuclei. The enormous effect of sesquiterpenes was revealed when the researchers added sesquiterpenes into the chamber with a suspension of only isoprenes and monoterpenes. **Even adding just two percent doubled the rate of new particle formation**. “This can be explained by the fact that a sesquiterpene molecule consists of 15 carbon atoms, while monoterpenes consist of only ten and isoprenes only five,” says Dada.
>
>On the one hand, the study reveals another mean by which vegetation can influence the weather and climate. Above all, however, the research results suggest that sesquiterpenes should be included as a separate factor in future climate models, alongside isopren and monoterpenes, to make their predictions more accurate. This is particularly true in light of the decrease in atmospheric sulphur dioxide concentrations and the simultaneous increase in biogenic emissions as a result of climate stress, meaning that the latter is likely to become increasingly important for our future climate

Abstract:
>The gut microbiota has emerged as an important modulator of cardiovascular and renal homeostasis. The composition of gut microbiota in patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD) is altered, where a lower number of bacteria producing short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) is observed. It is known that SCFAs, such as butyrate and acetate, have protective effects against cardiovascular diseases and CKD but their mechanisms of action remain largely unexplored. In the present study, we investigated the effect of butyrate and acetate on glomerular endothelial cells. Human glomerular microvascular endothelial cells (hgMVECs) were cultured and exposed to butyrate and acetate and their effects on cellular proliferation, mitochondrial mass and metabolism, as well as monolayer integrity were studied. While acetate did not show any effects on hgMVECs, our results revealed that butyrate reduces the proliferation of hgMVECs, strengthens the endothelial barrier through increased expression of VE-cadherin and Claudin-5 and promotes mitochondrial biogenesis. Moreover, butyrate reduces the increase in oxygen consumption induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS), revealing a protective effect of butyrate against the detrimental effects of LPS. Taken together, our data show that butyrate is a key player in endothelial integrity and metabolic homeostasis.",0

"Abstract:
>Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a key physiological regulator of metabolism and a target of therapeutic interventions for cardiometabolic and ageing-related disorders. Determining the factors and possible mechanisms of acute and adaptive SIRT1 response to exercise is essential for optimising exercise interventions aligned to the prevention and onset of disease. Exercise-induced SIRT1 upregulation has been reported in animals, but, to date, data in humans have been inconsistent. This exploratory systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess various exercise interventions measuring SIRT1 in healthy participants. A total of 34 studies were included in the meta-analysis (13 single bout exercise, 21 training interventions). Studies were grouped according to tissue sample type (blood, muscle), biomarkers (gene expression, protein content, enzyme level, enzyme activity), and exercise protocols. A single bout of high-intensity or fasted exercise per se increases skeletal muscle SIRT1 gene expression as measured by qPCR or RT-PCR, while repeated resistance training alone increases blood SIRT1 levels measured by ELISA. A limited number of studies also show a propensity for an increase in muscle SIRT1 activity as measured by fluorometric or sirtuin activity assay. In conclusion, exercise acutely upregulates muscle SIRT1 gene expression and chronically increases SIRT1 blood enzyme levels.",0

"Mental framing is a powerful tool for adapting, and poor people are forced to adapt all the time. Religion is essentially mass mental framing. I wouldn’t be surprised if many under privileged people have positive outlooks because it’s beneficial/protective for them to do so, and they don’t have wealth protection that would make up
for the loss of advantage/protection by having a view that framed things negatively. Even things like just managing stress “costs” a lot more when you don’t have money and have a negative outlook. I could even see socially how it might be taught to be positive in a generational way that is linked to enduring poverty and hardship.


On the protection factor of mental framing:

Honestly we should all be extremely concerned about how psych research has consistently been weaponized against the public by companies. I sometimes wonder how much of our rampant misery right now is because we are living under systems designed to make us that way (since happy healthy satisfied people do not consume like unhappy sick dissatisfied people searching for an easy fix do),0
"> Global population-weighted (PW) PM2.5 exposure, related to both pollution levels and population size, increased from 1998 (28.3 μg/m3) to a peak in 2011 (38.9 μg/m3) and decreased steadily afterwards (34.7 μg/m3 in 2019). Post-2011 change was related to exposure reduction in China and slowed exposure growth in other regions (especially South Asia, the Middle East and Africa)

"Hello, everyone!

We are in the unique & exciting position to potentially be the recipient of a community grant from Reddit. We’re not sure if our application will be successful, or how much money we’ll get. But, we wanted your input since this will directly impact you, the user. 

Some give-away ideas we are tossing around:

-	One month of therapy from an online therapy source, such as Better Help.
-	A copy of a book on relationships from an author such as Kerry Cohen, who was our frequent guest during the Reddit Talks era
-	A game designed to help you and your partner grow closer 
-	Donating to a charity or charities voted on by our users, most likely ones that help victims of domestic violence, as we sadly saw an explosion of domestic violence-themed posts during the COVID-19 lockdowns. 


Again, I cannot guarantee our grant request will be successful but since this will directly impact you, we wanted to get your feedback. Please take a minute to fill out this survey. It's completely anonymous, neither myself or anyone else on the moderation/admin team will see who answered what.

I wanted also to take this time to thank all 8.87 (!) million of you! You are what makes this subreddit so amazing. We may not be the biggest subreddit, but I'd like to think we're the most caring. It is because of our amazing userbase that we're even being considered.",0
He took fetish photos of your fucking mother. Come on now. You can't just suck this up.,0
"I think your concerns are valid and it would 100% be right to bring up your concerns with your ex. It might plant a seed that needs to be planted. I'd say have a conversation with him that goes something like this:

""Name, I'm VERY concerned about our dog (name). Given he was previously a very healthy, very loved dog, I'm concerned about how his life ended. I'm concerned that someone poisoned him - especially given he showed no indications of illness leading up to his passing.""",0
"He’s not moody, he’s manipulative. He’s selfish and immature. He has literally been dragging you all around too satisfy his need to be constantly stimulated. It sounds like he had impulse control issues. No, this is not normal. You know it’s not.",0

"He’s intentionally breaking you down.  This is only going to get worse.  You’re only a year in, go find someone better",0
His entitlement to your body would scare me. You are not safe if he genuinely believes what he’s saying. Divorce is definitely something to consider if he expects to use you at will whether or not you want it. *He is talking like a rapist*. If that does not disturb him you should be very scared.,0
"He’s already gone. Block him and move on. If he was concerned, he would’ve told you it wasn’t what it looked like and made up excuses.",0
"I think you’re asking a question that you already know the answer to because you’re hoping that somebody will convince you of the latter. At 40 years old, he’s not growing out of shit. 🤷‍♀️ 

He sounds like a major narcissist, and you definitely are settling right now babe..regardless of him having “good qualities“ , being verbally abusive, really just negates all of it, and makes him a POS. And the fact that your daughter is looking up to him as the man in her life when he is acting, so immature and ridiculous, is really sad, if you’re not going to leave for yourself, leave so that that’s not the type of example she has. 

I’m a mother myself and I left my ex because he didn’t do shit . And I didn’t want my son to grow up thinking that mommy was OK with doing everything and daddy didn’t have to do anything and he could grow up and be the same. 🤷‍♀️",0
"I'm so sorry about your friend and relative.

I'm going a different approach here, have you considered your wife's mental state and likely your own, you both sound burnt out. Your wife's reply about HAVING to do things before she can work maybe linked to OCD or a post partum issue, she has given birth twice in 2 years, that's alot.

I think you both need to organise some babysitting and take time to talk properly because you both can't go on like this.

Honestly good luck.",0
"You don’t do anything.  And also, you don’t enable her yourself if your parents get tired of it and expect you to take over.

It's a pretty sad thing that a 33 year old woman can't go to the mall and buy a dress by herself.,0
"I’m genuinely curious why you stayed with someone once you realised he has no empathy? This isn’t a normal thing. Not all men act like this, I’ve personally  only ever been with one guy like this, he was my first proper relationship and I didn’t realise it was an immediate red flag. I think you’re drawn to the wrong kind of guys if you keep experiencing this. There are so many guys out there that are caring and sensitive to other people’s feelings. In a relationship, you shouldn’t be afraid to ask for support. I got diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis recently (at only 24yo) and my boyfriend has been nothing but supportive and loving, offering to do everything for me that I struggle with due to pain. You deserve better than someone who claims to love you but doesn’t support you in the slightest.",0
"Dude I’m so sorry, but she was nowhere near ready to get into another relationship. There are some signs of that (like how quickly after the divorce she fell into a deep relationship) but ultimately I’m not trying to victim blame. She rushed and now she’s got cold feet and is rekindling with her ex.

You need to keep yourself safe. I know 6 months is a lot to lose but you’re just going to waste more if you stay.",0
"He supported you greatly for 13 years. From your post, I gathered, he was rather selfless about it, as he prioritised your dreams. This does not matter you owe him forgiveness for his affair, however I think that you at least shouldn't rush to make a decision on this.

&#x200B;

>In recent days he has been coming home early from work, he brings me flowers and chocolates. He initiates intimacy every night, (my libido is pretty high, but we only did it once a week because he was ""tired"").

Detestable example of love bombing. By the way, how long is it that he was ""tired"". He can claim this affair lasted only 5 months, but it is not like you can trust him right now.",0
"\#1. I would hire a PI.

This is a serious accusation and you need to be 100% sure.

You've done all the right things and then some. Your marriage is going downhill and at this point I don't see any chance for improvement. Best to get out of it.,0
Please go to a therapist and evaluate what attracted you to this person. You can’t heal with the other woman because you two would be working against one another and there would be no progress due to the trauma bond. You don’t even love your husband you are simply experiencing withdrawal. Please maintain some distance and talk to a therapist and lawyer to dissolve your marriage. You deserve better.,0

"So you could have gone on the trip on your own, as you originally intended, but you chose not to? If so, I can see her logic - since you were already planning to spend 280 without her, she only considers herself liable for half the additional cost. 

So the question is, why didn’t you go on your own? If it was at her request, she owes half of 354. But if you just soured on the trip on your own, it seems to me that she has a point.",0

"This is your future if you stay with him. Dismal. It is a deal breaker for me. He is apathetic at best.

The key to any relationship is conversation. You should talk to them about it. We don’t know the context of arguments and frankly you probably don’t know all the details of their relationship. I would strongly suggest explaining all of this to them.,0
"Get out of this messy ""relationship"" ASAP. 

He doesn't respect you. And yes, that's cheating.",0
"Question: when he said he was excited you were moving there, did he specifically say ""we should get together""?

My best guess so far is that he's either worried that his gf will not like you two hanging out, or she's even said that she's not ok with it. Whether you two are 100% platonic may not matter if that's a boundary she requires, unfortunately.",0
"You are right to be irritated, but you are wrong to sit around wasting your day- go out and do stuff. 

Put some water by the bed and go enjoy the day. When you get home, you can tell her that her being drunk and fighting is not enjoyable for you, and you aren't interesting in a relationship where that happens again. 

I get people getting drunk- been there myself- and sometimes it happens when we don't plan it (I've definitely had a hangover after 3 drinks and been like...what happened, I know my limit) But fighting is never okay, nor is keeping you up to fight, nor is keeping you up because she didn't have her key. 

So let her sleep off the hangover while you decide what you want to discuss with her about her behavior. Sure, people are late, sure people can get a little drunk, but it can't be a common occurrence and the 1 time it does happen, it should come with a big apology and then not happen again.",0
"There is nothing to compromise. He is clear about his needs and you are obscuring or lying about yours. 

Time to be completely honest. You can’t escape the truth and you both deserve clarity.",0
"Why would the ""friend"" come over after she got home? Did he see her wherever she was, and then set something in motion? I can honestly say, he would have left my house by ambulance.",0
"You really buried the lede here... I can't believe you put up with his disgusting body-shaming.

Don't compare this relationship to your past ones. Just because it's 100x healthier doesn't mean it's _healthy_.

Being friends with exes is something I've seen done in healthy ways, and have seen done in unhealthy ways. But him inviting and reaching out to a woman who has actually tried to hook up with him while he's in a relationship with you speaks volumes. You've been clear that you expect him to set boundaries and he's steamrolled right over them. You really need to ask yourself why including this woman is more important to him than _your_ feelings and boundaries. He's not stupid - he knows how you feel. You've told him. He just doesn't care.

The whole kid discipline thing is another yikes from me. Can't comment much more but seems like a major incompatibility",0

">He grew up in an abusive household and says that that is to blame

I read an article from a domestic violence expert once. He was saying how pretty much every abusive man says that. His response is always something like, ""If you were abused, that makes your behavior even worse. You know what it feels like to be abused, so you have no excuse for doing it to somebody else."" After that, the abusers don't bring up their tragic childhoods again since they know it won't get them anywhere. 

>In the last week, I think he has made some meaningful changes

There's no such thing as making meaningful changes in one week. Changes that have only existed for one week are meaningless fluff. They have to last a long time before they mean anything. 

>There is no baseline to return to, we would be building it. 

Why would that be worthwhile? You'd essentially be starting a new relationship. If you have to start a new relationship, there's no point in doing it with someone you already know to be an ass. 

The fact is, he is not making these changes for your sake. He would have done it much earlier if it was for your sake. He's only doing it now that he is facing consequences. 

Think of it like... like taking good care of your car. You don't do it because you love or respect your car. You do it because, if you don't, your car might stop working, and that would be a pain in the ass for YOU. 

That's what your husband is doing right now. It would be very unpleasant and inconvenient for him him him him him if you left. 

And if you don't leave? This is what he'll learn: ""My wife is never gonna leave. She'll just pretend she's gonna leave, but that's bullshit. As long as I grovel, that idiot will come back. lol""",0

Then we rebooked the flight for the next day (because we turned up at the airport we actually were allowed to transfer with minimal extra costs). So we missed a day of our honey moon.

Edit:
We got an “urgent passport” not an emergency passport. At the time this happened they had a rapid access service - they did charge a priority processing fee.",0
Let this lady go. Don't feel guilt. You've done nothing wrong. You will get pulled into her BS and you don't need that.,0
"THe lack of communication is a problem. It was your boyfriend's responsibility to communicate with you what the expectations were AHEAD of time. It sounds like because you were uncomfortable you chose to be stand-offish. That is a bad look to others but somewhat understandable considering you weren't given any real communication about expectations.

Honestly? I think you need to move on. Your BF either sees you as a place holder or more as a convenience for him rather than someone with long term potential. The fact that after 2 years you didn't have anyone in his family's contact info, the fact that he thinks so little of you that he didn't feel the need to communicate critical details with you and then treated you like an afterthought... none of that is good.

At 29 you are in the prime of your youth (I say that in my late 40s). Enjoy the time with people who value you and WANT to build a life with you. Not compartmentalize you or treat you like an accessory. Please seriously consider what you want and how he treats you in all circumstances because this didn't come out of no where. My guess is there have been many previous instanes of him treating you like an inconvenience or an accessory.",0

"You gotta decide when to let things go. 

I don’t really understand the fork example, cuz why would your feelings be hurt that she couldn’t open her fork?

For the eggs, you say (while she’s cracking them) “hey I like my eggs a little runnier”. Or (and I know this is a wild take), you cook the eggs how you like

My boyfriend also leaves lights on and it used to drive me nuts. Then I decided to choose to not let it drive me nuts. If he leaves a light on, and I’m the next person in the room, I simply ask him if he’s done in that room and turn the light off. The potential cost of nagging him to turn the lights off is far greater than just hitting the switch. 

The way he used to load the dishwasher would make me insane. I put all the forks together, all the spoons together, all the plates of the same size together, cuz it would make unloading it easier. He just throws everything in. And when I tried to micromanage him, he just gave me this look like I grew a second head. Do the dishes get clean his way? They sure do. Does it take me maybe an extra 10 seconds to unload the dishwasher his way? Sure. Is 10 seconds worth making my bf feel like I don’t appreciate him and don’t trust him to adult effectively? Absolutely not. 

You gotta ask yourself why you take it *so personally* when she does t hese things. Big things? Yeah, you absolutely need to talk about those in the moment. But little things?

"This girl is being incredibly inappropriate, chasing down your boyfriend knowing he is dating you. I would have a serious talk with your boyfriend and try to set boundaries. Explain that you're uncomfortable with what this girl is doing and why. It also seems that her boyfriend deserves to know about this because this is also unfair to him. Regardless, I think your suspicions are spot on, and I think you would feel better talking to your boyfriend and coming up with a plan to address this problem so it doesn't continue.",0
"Yes he’s truthful as far as this is concerned 
Pornstars send nudes lately to generate impression for their only fans account and also to sell content 
They enjoy sending snaps to random friends and encouraging them to subscribe for more private content or premium content so I think he’s been truthful about that .",0

"Personally I'd find it weird to have exactly the same interests and hobbies as my wife. We share some, but certainly not all... Her support of my interests is more than I could ever ask for and I'm very thankful for that.

Honestly I don't know the guy so can't say much. We can't force people to stay with us, but if he thinks he can find someone that will share his passions exactly and will be a good partner in all other aspects he's probably going to be disappointed.

Relationships are all about finding the common language and a compromise. He clearly doesn't think so.",0
"You can express your concern but past that, there's really not much you can do.

She's an adult and no matter how ridiculous her decisions are, she's going to make them. You can't help someone that doesn't see anything wrong with their behavior.",0
He sounds like a wimp. Find somebody who helps your mental health.,0
"This won’t be the last time you experience this.  When some people get in a relationship they get so wrapped up in their partner and want to spend every minute with them.  That’s not a healthy way to have a relationship but it is how some people are.

You guys expressed you want to spend more time with her and she clearly doesn’t want to so make plans amongst yourselves.  The only point I think worth saying to her is that when you are planning a girls night in, she’s welcome to join you but that you prefer her boyfriend not be there during that time.

Unless they break up soon, I think your friendship is probably over.",0
"The way I see it you’ve got 1 of 2 options…

1). Continue to Lie. Hope that she doesn’t find out the truth. You already opened that door when you lied instead of being truthful, so, tough to walk it back now. 

2). Come clean. Face the possibility she drops you. Because, you lied. And, she probably lost a bit of trust. If you lied about that, she may wonder what else you would have lied about (the “Hickey” will look a lot worse for you now)

And then moving forward you have the standard 3rd option:

3). Don’t. Lie. Be. Honest.",0
"I'm just wondering why you're still with him. He's a selfish, inconsiderate asshole who has absolutely zero respect for you. Is he the only man left in town?",0
"My partner and I (in our 40s) both share our location with a couple friends who live nearby, but both of them have their names saved. I also share with my mother and my best friend, who both live in a different city from me. Sharing with unsaved people seems weird, but maybe it’s an age thing?",0
"Say thank you, I love you too, but not in that way, I'm straight and love your sister. We will always be best friends and one day brothers Inaw

EDIT: read it through again, say nothing for now, but monitor the situation, and somepoint make reference to that night and see what happens.

So either your friend is Bi or Gay and closeted or he's very lonely and in his drunk mind you are the most important person so acted out

Maybe mention to GF why does she think her brother is single? See if she says something she suspects",0
"You don’t break them up. You can’t control someone else’s actions. The best thing you can do is be a friend and hope that, if she is in a bad and abusive situation, she will realize it and leave.  

Don’t be pushy, don’t try to be a hero, just be a friend that she can go to if she needs to.",0
"You're completely right.

Its hard to have a genuine vacation together when the foundation is unstable.

You'd essentially be faking your companionship. But what can you really do besides try and enjoying yourselves?

This trip seems like it will be a conclusion of things, for better or for worse.

To increase chances, maybe its best to be the bigger positive person always and attempt to make the most of it.

That way, by the end of it... You can confidently say:

>I tried my best effort to get along and clearly this isn't working out. I know we have a lot of things to sort out, but I figured with our trip, we could at least put all that behind us temporarily and enjoy each-others company again. 

If you feed into negativity, that will seal the fate here.",0

"Oh holy crap. You created this crap. What a child needs is 2 parents who love him and each other and in a perfect world wanted the baby.  What they don’t need is 2 parents that are you and her. First. Quit drinking. She didn’t make you an alcoholic. That’s not how it works. Best advice?  Get a lawyer. Absolutely be involved in your child’s life. Those are the only 2 sure things. If you want, get into couples counseling and start dating if you both want that. Don’t jump into a marriage because of this toxic mess. Time to start living with integrity. Both of you. A child can be just as damaged by growing up around chaos and resentment as they can by a situation where their parents are not together. Do not let her blackmail you into a marriage because it was your sperm that made it through. She does not have all the power here. You both need to get your acts together. Find a therapist. Yesterday. You don’t walk away because it always comes out. Kid gets hurt, finds out his blood type and realizes that dad didn’t want them. Don’t do that.",0
She sounds kinda dumb dude. Might be time to find someone else.,0
"So tell him. Some people like to show their girlfriends off, and some girlfriends like to be shown off. It's okay for you to feel differently, but assuming he should automatically know this without you telling him is plainly silly.

This is a good habit to get into in general. Every successful relationship in human history is based on two people who just _actually tell each other_ what they want and think and feel and need. So take this opportunity to attempt to have a successful relationship. =)",0

"Ill tell you something you probably dont want to hear. Your never going to be able to convince your mom, she has been deeply indoctrinated that marriage is a source of a womans happines and that woman who failed to get married are failures. 

She believes she is working on your best interest and as long as she believes that there is nothing you can do or say that will change her mind.

If you are not dependant financially on them my advice is to cut them off even after you get a boyfriend or get married your mom is going to constantly hound you into doing or being what she tells you",0

"Spousal abuse is abuse, whether male or female victim. This is physical, emotional, intellectual, financial abuse.
Make a note of everything - diarise dates, times, photos of any bruises or damage to belongings - and HIDE it where she can't find it.
This will help you when you decide your ready to leave the relationship. Create a new bank account she doesn't know about & move a small percentage of your funds into this each pay. Let a trusted friend or family member know whats been going on and help you plan your escape.
She will use her attorney mother for sure, she already is threatening you with it, but if you diarise EVERYTHING the truth will prevail.
Note also any bills you pay, items you purchase for the house, car payments, amounts you put into joint accounts. This will assist you with proof of contribution to relationship. And TAKE THIS WITH YOU when you leave.
Good luck!",0

"I’m sorry you’re going through this.  A lot of young relationships simply don’t work out.  You need to get yourself a job and find a way to move out of your parents home.  Once you can show stability, you can get a lawyer to help you get a custody agreement in place.  In the meantime, keep visiting your child as often as you can.

Reach out to old friends if you can, or try joining a club for something you’re interested in where you can meet people that share your interest.  I’m sure you’ll make new friends that way.

When you’re ready, get yourself back in the dating game.

Don’t focus so much on the negative thoughts.  You still have your wonderful daughter.  You can do this!",0

As for her depression, family life, etc. Not your problem and not an excuse for her behavior.",0
"He seems pretty open and communicative about it. He’s not hiding it. If you need more clarity on how you should feel, flip the players.

If you went out with 2 male coworkers, just to drink, would you be annoyed/put off if he was skeptical about it?",0
"I don't know who gave you that crappy advice but it's not true lol. People should 100% talk about their past relationships so their partner is better equipped to know why you behave and think the way you do in relationships.

You can tell him you have been in bad relationships where you were cheated on before, and it helped you learn new boundaries, self respect, and that you will never let a partner treat you that way again. That if anyone ever did that you would be gone immediately. It's healthy to discuss deal breakers with a partner though cheating should be common sense when in an exclusive relationship.",0
"Break it off now, he wants to sleep with other women and if going behind your back already. Soon he will be cheating and compromise your health. It will get worse, if he wants to be poly he needs to find someone who wants the same. 

Also, age gap. Is he reaching out to other young women because he wants a harem of 21yds on rotation?",0

"I think that sometimes we let go of a good thing because things slow down too much, there’s not enough excitement, things get boring.

She seems super-keen which is both sweet and alarming. She’s been LDR for so long that she must be stoked to finally have dates and everything that goes with being in a proper IRL relationship.

He considers you a friend. Period.

"Tell her you’re broke, then she’ll break up with you, then you’ll see her true worth and intentions.",0
"You need to report all of this to everyone who will listen. It is so expensive to take any class, especially one in which you are expected to drop such a large amount on supplies you may or may not actively need. Then this teacher is clearly not teaching the topics you guys need to learn, straying off the subject and syllabus, then giving you the tests you are supposed to be taking for the class (so HE can meet some sort of guidelines for the curriculum) but hasn't properly set up any sort of lesson plan on the course material. I would be pissed and demand that we were allowed to retake the exams, and be given a teacher who actually knows how to teach. It is not enough for them to hire some tradesman with no teaching experience.

As far as I know, teachers are given a lesson plan based on the curriculum they are expected to provide to the class. Then the teachers are expected to formulate their own lesson plan based on this syllabus of curriculum, and can teach it however they wish, but they are expected to test and quiz on specific topics and such by a certain time.Clearly this guy doesn't know what he is doing. He isn't training employees on a job site- he is a teacher at a college who are charging their students a large sum of money to become certified in this trade, and there is a sort of trust between a college and it's students in which you shouldn't have to worry that this sort of thing could happen!

You should get together with some of the other students and all of you come together to the dean, or a student services advisor who can help you take the proper steps through the proper channels to take this on.

If you are allowed to voice record lessons for note taking purposes, do it, then use the recordings as examples of what's going on within the class. Show them your notes for what was taught prior to that test, and show them that he never even touched upon the course ,material that you guys were expected to be tested upon. 

It's not right and with the cost of schooling they better have teachers who are not only pros on their topics but *know how to teach students*. Get your parents involved if it doesn't seem to be going anywhere. The school is responsible for remedying this and if it goes unreported they cannot offer any solutions or fix the issues.",0
"Life is too short to spend it on complicated relationships.

I never mess with people who are in contact with exes.

Can past relationships end civilly and maintain friendships? Absolutely.

However, there is the other side of the story where its a refusal to move on and residual feelings exist.

The juice ain't worth the squeeze.

Why bother dealing with a complicated relationship when you can invest elsewhere that doesn't include the ex complication...

If you're going to entertain a relationship where the ex is a prominent figure in your partners life... They best be bringing their A game and know how to navigate that with their new partner.

Doing this:

* Hiding things from your partner.
* Surprise! I am actually tight with my ex and you never knew it.
* I don't want to talk about this, gonna ignore you and go to bed.
* I made a sketchy environment and now I get pull the ""You don't trust me, you're the problem, you're just insecure"" card.

That shit doesn't work.

If you're involving yourself with someone whose close to an ex, you should be ensuring that your partner is transparent, and mature enough to understand the position they're putting you in, meanwhile knowing how to navigate it in order for you to be comfortable.

Shifting blame and guilting you into ""you don't trust me"" is not the approach here and is a red flag situation.

Life is too short and love is too valuable to waste it on complicated relationships like this.",0

"Old lady here. Been with my husband for 38 years now. There’s been plenty of times that our relationship kinda got in a groove of taking each other for granted and each of us focused on our own needs not being met, and that causing a cycle of blame and resentment. (You’re not meeting my needs, why should I meet yours). What worked for me was finally telling him that if I didn’t know him, and we had just started dating, I would have never continued the relationship. He felt the same way. So we made a conscious decision to treat each other as someone we wanted to date and give each other respect. Of course there will be times when one partner needs more support or attention due to life being filled with stress and changes. But it takes attention and involvement with each other on a daily basis to sustain a friendship and a marriage.",0

"I don't think anyone on Reddit can give you a straight answer here, and anyone who claims to have it is lying.

Sexuality is weird. The question you have to ask yourself is, are you attracted to your boyfriend? You might be bisexual leaning towards women, you might be fully lesbian, only you can figure that out for yourself (maybe with the help of a therapist). If you enjoy having sex with your boyfriend, then there's no real reason to leave him. If you don't, they you should leave him since it's not fair to either of you.",0

"If you trust that he won’t trash your stuff, video is a good idea. It’s going to hurt. That can’t be avoided. But doing this by video gives him the space to process without you and your parents there. It also gives him time to be elsewhere if he doesn’t want to face all of you. If there’s any chance that he’s abusive, forget everything I just said. Since I’m not hearing that, I won’t go into the way you leave if he’s abusive.",0
"It sounds like, if I sum up your words in this post, like you don't see a future with him any longer. You can be in love and attracted to someone, but know that they're not the right fit for you. Don't beat yourself up about commitments you've made up until now - life changes, situations change, and feelings change. It's not like you haven't tried to have conversations about the things that aren't working, so no need to feel guilty (although I know, easier said than done). You're absolutely right that if you know you're no longer invested in the relationship, the right thing to do for you both is to end it.

"Even though this was a hypothetical conversation, it cannot be ignored. 

These things don't get brought up without reason.

You two have completely different views for relationships. 

Couples have fallen apart because one side asked to open the relationship up.

Knowing that your partner is capable of loving people outside of you, will be damaging for most people. 

Your perception of how you thought he viewed your relationship, just took a massive hit. That is hard to comeback from.

Don't force yourself to be in love with someone who doesn't view love the same way as you. You're setting yourself up for a rocky relationship.",0
That’s what I assumed which is why it weirded me out.,0

"Does it show as “read”? Tonight, I would literally break it down for him.  “ I need to talk to you and I need you to be 100% I’m honest with me. You owe me that. I’m feeling very uncomfortable about the other day at the bar and feel as though you aren’t being entirely truthful. 

1. You told me at 1:00am that you were waiting for an Uber 
2. You then get home 2.5 hours later and tell me coworker A dropped you off . 
3. You then stated you never ordered an Uber although I have a text from you stating you were waiting for an Uber. 
4. You then changed your story the next day and told me coworker B took you home.

"Until you’ve sufficiently healed from this breakup, you have to look at your relationship with your ex as a business relationship. The main focus of a business relationship is the business. The main focus of your relationship with your ex needs to be your child. If it doesn’t concern the child in some way, you two shouldn’t be discussing it. Set a parenting schedule that allow you both to spend equal time with the baby and hold him to it. Also, make a decision now about when it’s appropriate for new partners to be introduced to your child and whether or not the other parent should be informed of that meeting before it happens. 

Most importantly, take the time to forge your own path in life outside of being a mom. Whether it’s going to school or starting a business, do it. The more you develop your own personal identity, the more at peace you’ll feel about this breakup.",0

"honestly I think a dude scrolling on instagram or youtube really doesnt care about any women he sees on there. It's like seeing women in a commercial or talking to the waitress at a restaurant. Even if he was like oh man im in love with angelina jolie or some shit like that, if he met her in real life he'd probably be like oh she's stuck up and cold hearted and she lame

"I don’t think he doesn’t want it. Moving in with someone is a big big step. Especially for someone who does value their alone time. 

Think of it like this… someone works or goes to school, or both. They’re busy throughout the week and perhaps being alone ‘recharges their batteries’ so to speak. Or the saying ‘it fills up their cup’ …alone time can be a form is self care. 

So he’s not sure if he’ll be able to have his alone time when fully living with someone. Perhaps if you move in together he can have an office space where he can go to be alone? Obviously he will have to be mindful that he’s not alone *all* the time though. 

I think having open and honest conversations about this topic will be helpful in making that big decision in the future when the time is right. 

You’ll need to respect his alone time, and he’ll need go respect you wanting to have ‘together time’ too.",0

"This is messed up. Sure you can have love for someone but dislike them as a person, like you would a family member or something- like your annoying great uncle. You would be sad if he died but you aren't actively in his life.

But for your girlfriend to think this? That's screwed up. What is she getting from the relationship if she doesn't particularly like you as a person and is basically dating other people? She is having her cake and eating it too in some way. Giving her gifts, spending money on her- perhaps the life you provide her is too tempting to hold onto so she keeps you hanging around while she's able to go out and pursue other people that she's actually attracted to.

Typically in poly relationships the belief is that you have a lot of love to give and do not wish to limit yourself to one person bc you do not believe in monogamy. But if she doesn't like you why is she even with you? I would 100% break things off with her, so that way you can focus on your own self and in the future find someone who puts as much time and effort into the relationship as you are.",0

"Meh whatever bro.

We have all done something like that before.

Saying I love you after your 4th kiss, yup that is rapid pace.

But you two laughed it off and moved on from it.

Didn't seem to create a massive rift in your connection.

You were just expressing your infatuation and maybe could have used different words to communicate it.

But whatever, there are worse things you could have done.

As long as it didn't break your connection and cause her to withdrawal, just continue to develop your connection.

Your friend is sending you down rabbit holes that you don't need to be going down.

You and your GF are both 18... Your friend is likely also 18... He probably doesn't have a clue to what he is talking about himself.

This is apart of your youth. Falling in love and figuring shit out as you go.

Do you think your friend knows better than you?

He doesn't.

Neither of you do (no offence). And only through your experiences (this girl you're with) will you learn these type of things.

So, fall in love.

Do stupid shit.

Make mistakes.

Learn.

Develop.

That is what you're doing right now.

Learn to trust your own judgment over others.",0

"You're asking how to fix this but by the way you worded this I can just FEEL that you're not truly sorry. So it's impossible to fix anything. You're like well yeah I broke a boundary which is bad but it wasn't that serious. That's not the point. She now thinks she can't trust you (fairly), it will take a lot to fix that",0

"It looks like your girlfriend is a poor listener. You have tried to make an effort in multiple ways to not only express to her how you feel about the lack of intimacy, but to also try to find solutions, all of which she continually shuts down. It's selfish of her to act like your concerns are ""weird for making a problem out of it"", bc a 2 yr relationship, when things should be only getting stronger and so close to that honeymoon phase we all talk about, shouldn't have such a lack of intimacy as if you guys are an old married couple with a sexless relationship or something.

If you really want some answers you gotta hold her feet to the metaphorical sex flame. Tell her something like ""Look, we gotta talk. I have tried on several occasions to tell you that I need more from this relationship and have tried to make efforts to fix our intimacy issues- which are an issue, at least for me. Either we need to both be making more of an effort or I do not see the point in dragging this relationship out."" If you crave something your partner is not giving you it is your job to express that then give your partner a little bit of time to remedy their behavior. If she doesn't then you can at least say that you tried to communicate with her, and feel good about breaking things off with her if things do not improve.

Just because she doesn't see a problem with it doesn't mean your opinions aren't valid. Does she have any reasons for why she doesn't pursue or seem to enjoy sex? Does she have a low sex drive, or some sort of past traumas involving sexual relationships in her past? It is worth delving into if she will talk with you about it, but if she keeps shrugging it off or calls you weird, which is a real negative ass way to talk to someone you supposedly love, then she's not the one for you.",0

"You broke the rules. You would be breaking them again by trying to get her to talk when she doesn’t want to. I think it’s incredibly hard to go straight from relationship to friendship. Sometimes usually still has feelings and well, you know all about that. Question. What would you be fighting for?",0
"You can ask him if he wants to be more serious but past that, there's not much else you can do. You can't MAKE someone see you as a girlfriend if they aren't interested.",0
"Ignore it. That’s her girlfriend, not yours. Just cut as wide a berth as you can around her and brush off the rest. Her feelings about your friendship aren’t relevant to you. If it reaches a head, they can talk it out.",0
"That’s concerning and yes, the age gap is too big. The priority should be for you to play catch up by focusing on yourself.",0
"I dunno darling, but I agree you are the company you keep. If he’s willing to watch his friends cheat over and over, he probably doesn’t have a problem with it.

Set your boundaries, make them clear. I know you say you “trust” him but if you’re panicked about it, your gut is telling you something else",0
"Your GF has low self esteem and thinks she's as ugly as the woman in the wheelchair so she thinks you would leave her for someone else ""of the same caliber."" She's not threatened by the pretty one because she thinks you have a ""type."" It's a complete low self esteem issues.",0
Cause he’s 10 years older than you.  You’re a child dating an adult.  Why do you think any **30 year old** is with someone a while 10 years younger than them?  Y’all almost weren’t even in school at the same time.,0
"Keep doing what you’re doing. No more WhatsApp. She needs to act like an adult and speak directly. If she/they leave the kitchen a mess, don’t clean it for them and consider snapping a photo for the next time she approaches you about cleaning. Save as much as you can for a down payment to get your own place in 6 months. Having a goal like that to focus on may help you get through the time more easily.",0

She is unlikely to get better for a very long time. Encourage her to contact social services to get psychological and financial help. You do not need to stay in a relationship with her if it’s not mutually satisfying. I can see how you would want to see her connected to a helper to replace you. Do NOT move in with her.,0
"Oh I see, I’m so sorry for misunderstanding. Still, it seems you have some healing to do. There’s nothing wrong with having fond memories of your previous relationship, but this seems to be a major distraction for you. 

If your ex hasn’t moved on that’s not on you. Don’t just focus on the good memories of him, that just puts him on a pedestal. You broke up with him for a reason, work on focusing on how much better your new boyfriend is for you. 

Can your new boyfriend go with you to the park sometimes?  Having him there, and your ex seeing you together, may help calm your anxiety. 

Again, I’m sorry for the misunderstanding. I really wish you and your boyfriend all the best.",0

Why are you engaged to a 22 year old who doesn’t even live near you? Definitely break up,0
"A reality check is required.

It may be too late to fix this sort of thing.

The other persons perception of you and how they think you view them... Is insanely fragile. If you drop the ball on that, it can be a no coming back from kind of deal. And yes, something as liking other woman's (assuming thirst trap) posts, can trigger it.

Seeing your partner desire other people cuts very deep for the other person.

If you're 5 months in and already struggling to keep your relationship together... Might be better to let things fall apart and move onto something new where this complication doesn't exist. 

Not a whole lot you can do when the other person is always assuming you're going to cheat.

"Yeah it's also a shock since there was nothing evident that she might be facing this issue. I don't bring up other people's personal issues anyways but thank you for telling me so i re remember aswell. I did try to rationalize it while validating her feeling to try and calm her down but i do now realise i should just listen she probably knows the info already. Thank you.

I'm really sorry you have a family history of that. Tbh I'm really scared she might get pregnant and miscarry ik I'd be super bad for her mentally ik it's normally horrible but she's already been struggling her entire life and i can't imagine having to go through that.

"With my (25F) boyfriend (27M), I asked him out on the second date after I thanked him for driving me home on our first. The early stages of our relationship made me finally realize a couple things:

Life is WAY too short to overthink asking a question that will have little to no impact on your life if the answer isn’t yes. 

It doesn’t matter if a woman is forward. Being the aggressor can be sexy as hell to some men. I was VERY much the aggressor with my bf - when I look back on things I did, I get so embarrassed lol. Our 2nd date I asked to hold his hand and then when he dropped me off home I asked if I could give him a kiss on the cheek 🤦🏾‍♀️ no idea where I got that confidence (can I even call it that???) from.

Just rip off the bandaid. You’ll get that second date, but even if you don’t, that’s still okay. I’m a strong believer in if it’s meant to be, it will be. 

Good luck!!!!",0
"You just have to give it time, since there really isn’t. any way to expedite getting over someone. It took me years to get over my ex from over a decade ago. Not saying it’ll take you that long but we all move at our own pace. 

Try getting back to *you*. Your hobbies, the things you did before your relationship. Meet new people, make new experiences and memories during this period.",0

I’ve already had this talk with him that’s why I’m kinda upset about it. I’ve already told him I don’t like him talking to his exes but he’s gone and done it again.,0
"3 times a day doesn't sound sustainable.

If you two are having it once a week, you're considered an active sex life.

What I tell couples with mismatching drives, focus on the quality, not the quantity.

Nail home the sex chemistry and make it so that when you two do have sex, its out of this world.

3, 10 minute half assed sessions a week, or one crazy passionate 2 hour session a week.

The 2 hour session is what people ultimately want, to feel the bedroom fire and genuinely desired by their partner.

If you can make the activity high level, then going once a week becomes less noticeable.  You know its going to happen, you know the fire is thriving, and the sex feels genuine... That kind of satisfaction is typically what people are after.

And you may have to consider that you two are sexually incompatible... You're into a lot more than he is, however, he can explore those things if he gives it a shot. But, again... You can't force things the other person doesn't want.

Now... There is the other side of your relationship to discuss that could be contributing.

* There is a thing as spending too much time together.
* Falling into a dull routine where you're doing the same things over and over.
* LDR, not sure who moved to who. But if he moved here, it could be isolating and kind of depressing if you gave up your previous life in order to start a new one.
* Struggling in other areas such as work or financially can also kill drives.
* Putting too much focus on sex can be counter productive. Sometimes bringing less attention to it can actually encourage the other to open more.

When you're investing into a long term relationship, there is nothing wrong with ensuring that you're getting everything you want out of it. Compromising is great to adapt, but your relationship vision, should closely reflect your reality.",0

"I'd just end it. Feeling like being around your partner is a chore is usually a big indicator that this isn't going to work long term.

Because if you liked her even as a friend, you'd enjoy hanging out with her. Just sounds like the newness of the relationship was the only thing that was keeping it going.

Just be vague and say that it's not working anymore.",0
"This post doesn’t really highlight “mental abuse” but for whatever it’s worth, my (25F) boyfriend (24M) would literally move mountains for me to make sure I wasn’t uncomfortable, let alone in a situation where I could be stung by a wasp - allergic or not. 

If you guys have been together for almost 8 years, I don’t see him doing a complete 180 in personality anytime soon. You also mentioned that it’s been very difficult most of the way, relationships are not supposed to be difficult. If you are genuinely unhappy, separate and explore who you are by yourself for a bit. This sub doesn’t like the “breakup” advice but more people genuinely need to hear it, *especially* young people.",0
"I agree, I would definitely just ask her what would make her feel special or loved. Or you guys could even do a love language test together, which could give you some ideas as to what to do?",0
It sounds to me like you know what you need to do. His excuses for talking to and planning to meet up with another girl are flimsy at best. You don’t “get distracted” and start secretly talking to/arranging to meet up with someone else. Nor does stress about work cause this situation. He’s looking to cheat. He may already be cheating. C’mon you know you’re better than this. Leave this guy.,0
"I’ve been in similar situations before, I liked the guy at first, we started dating very casually and then slowly started getting the ick as I got to know him better and decided I didn’t want to pursue things. But cause I was younger (around your age) and dumber I thought it would be kinder to slowly let things fizzle out the way Jennifer is doing, rather than say what the issue is straight-up and risk hurting his self confidence badly. Also, I’m half Latina myself and you calling her “your Latina” is a major ick, maybe that was part of the reason",0
Here’s an idea. Don’t make it a birthday party. A surprise party from the friends that love you. She’ll never expect that and you won’t have to invite her twin or her family. For her birthday?  A picnic in a beautiful location. Just a thought.,0
We wish you the best in life and dont worry man🫡,0

"My guy friend hates vegetables. Will not eat them in any form. Even the thought of eating them, to him, makes him sick. Fruit is very hit or miss. We’ve deduced he only likes the fruit that is the “worst” for you. (The fruit that’s basically candy). My boyfriend and I ordered a pizza with green peppers on it, expecting that he could just take them off, and he acting extremely offended that we dare assume that, and lost his appetite from looking at it. 

His home life as a child contributed to this. Without making this long af, his dad essentially was a “yes, man” and never made him eat vegetables (or a lot of other things) and has mentally stunted him as well. We’re slowly helping him. He had no idea food had nutritional labels. He never cared to look at packages and no one taught him. He didn’t know that eggs were good for you. He thought they were junk food like donuts. Which he thought junk food was just “fake factory food” and not “real food” (think pastes of plastic and chemicals turned into food) and not just high calorie, because he also didn’t know what a calorie was. 

He’s a very odd dude. He’s 26. How he has made it this far in life, I don’t know. I started a notepad list of “Shit (his name) Says” of all the crazy things he has said. “Why do we have to use soap in the shower?” “Why is being an alien illegal? Shouldn’t we try to befriend aliens for their technology?”",0

"It’s called “*exonyms*”.

Germany is a tricky one, because it was the name that the Roman Empire gave to that area. But the very people didn’t call themselves that.

However, remote places kept the reference to the Roman name. And adding that until 250 years ago the fastest way you could travel was on a horse, people stuck with a lot of exonyms, letting them be cemented into language long before we had more direct communication.",0

"I'm not sure this is the right subreddit considering there isn't a question involved but.

This is a hard lesson to learn. One I had to learn myself. You deserve to have friends in your life that actually care for you and enjoy your company. Don't settle for simply being tolerated. Don't give people more energy than they're giving you.

I did this myself, I stopped reaching out first. And suddenly I found myself friendless because no one of my friends actually wanted me in their life. I went and got better friends. 

We don't live in a society where it is socially acceptable to tell someone you don't vibe with them, or you don't like them. So a lot of people have friends they only tolerate.",0
"You enjoy them while they're here, and you do the best you can when they are. It's alright to feel sad and to cry about it. You're human and you can't expect to be unphased by something like that. 

>How do you not get consumed by hurt/sadness in moments like this? Aging is natural and there will always be a grief to watching your parents get old. But how do you not get completely consumed by this grief?

You let it flow, and then you realize that life just keeps going anyway. You get back on your feet and you continue to move forward. It's just the way of things. 

Let your grief flow, embrace it. Emotions dissipate with time, and then soon enough you'll be fine again.",0

Ignorance of basic science is indeed woefully common.,0
"Challenge your insurance (if in U.S.). If they have already processed and paid the claim, ask them about the difference. Start by asking them what the *billed* amount was, then ask what the *allowed* amount was. If they are different, ask why. Some way or another, they should have some way they are able to consider the full allowed amount. 

This is where it gets tricky and depends on plan design. If you have a deductible that you have to meet first, hang up, let it go and yell out a few curse words. If you have full coverage, push them to allow the *entire* billed amount, they should be able to do this somehow, some way. Different companies call it different things, but nearly every carrier has a policy for surprise ambulance billing. Some call it a hold harmless clause, or outlier cost management or something similar, but be very, very pushy about them allowing the full billed amount. Ask for supervisors, demand SPD (full plan breakdown), make them back up their No. If still nothing, go above them. Go to whoever owns the plan, which would likely be your employer, and report it. Or if it's a marketplace plan, call your admin or sales guy and tell them you either want it fixed or your dropping the plan-tell them you feel it's deceptive and you're not going to engage with that type of business.",0
Loitering in my god damn halls without paying no god damn rent,0
"I don't know what to tell you, except that not _everyone_ reads the same way you and your friends do. Reading in sequence, and re‑reading before a new release, is _fairly common_, but not universal. So authors will often cater to the full wider audience.

Similarly, not every reader is intently devoted to the book they're reading. Sometimes attention lapses into skimming when some part doesn't hold as much interest, or a book is put down for a month or two before coming back to it. Or the reader may just not have a very good memory. So brief internal recaps are designed to refamiliarise key points just before they become necessary to understand the next bit, making a book more of an 'easy read' rather than a demanding one.

But certainly not every book does this. Maybe you need to find different authors who write more to your preferred style.",0

"Having too many sources of credit can be bad for you in the US, too. The main thing they're eyeballing is how well you manage your debt, ie that you make payments on time, aren't keeping your credit maxed out, etc. Having something sent to collections, a foreclosure, bankruptcy, and the like will tank your credit.

You don't need to have a credit history to get credit, but you're going to have high interest rates on what credit you *do* get. This isn't such a bad thing on a credit card, so long as you keep it paid off. It does suck mightily if you're looking at a long term loan, such as a house.

There's a lot of benefit to using credit cards for most transactions in the US. Firstly, they provide excellent protection against fraud, which debit cards do not. If someone charges a bunch of things to your DC, you're pretty much shit outta luck. CC, they have your back. Secondly, if you pay off the balance of your credit card each month, there is zero interest charged. Thirdly, many cards provide a cash back program, where they give 1 to 5% cash back to the cardholder on every purchase. It's not a lot, but it certainly adds up over time. Free money.

Lastly, the easiest way in the world to build credit is to put your utilities on autopay to a credit card, and put that card on autopay for the full balance from your checking. You'll build up great credit without even thinking about it.",0

"I agree with you, OP. Reddit is terrible for new accounts. In order to gain some karma, you basically need to comment in r/askreddit and maybe some other low-karma subs for some time.",0
"Did you have a traumatic experience in your past caused by one or more men? A lot of women have issues with men (such as father figures or romantic partners) due to past abuse (sexual or otherwise) that can cause them to be aloof and standoffish with them. 

Even if you're man, I feel like this could apply to you as well. I've heard and read stories of men who were sexually assaulted by other men also becoming this way. 

If you don't have a traumatic experience, then you may just have more in common with the women around you than you do other men. Are your interests and hobbies more aligned with those of women than other men? You say you're more introverted with other men and extroverted with women. This might be because you have more in common with women and can enjoy yourself fully while with men, their interests and hobbies might not be for you, hence you're not really enjoying yourself. 

If this is the case, perhaps seek out other men who have those similar interests such as you, and see if you behave the same as you would with your female friends. 

If not of any of the above, then there are still a few other possibilities. 

Did you grow up surrounded by more women than men and hence, feel more comfortable around them? Were you bullied by other boys in school that could have made you more wary of men in general? There are a lot of possibilities honestly.",0

Everyone ganged up on her, even Kendrick. “You can sing everything except one word” then why bring her up? It almost looks explicitly like a trap.  Imagine being asked to recite a Shakespeare poem from memory and then you’re told to remove 10% of the words. 

While the word itself is used in a cultural way amongst black people, in the end it only creates further division and as long as one side can say it and the other side can’t, there will be no progress whatsoever between the strife that black and white people still go through. It’s a never-ending cycle. You can’t let white people say it, and you can’t let black people NOT say it, so here we are…

"You could get mobile internet, or wireless internet.

Mobile internet can be costly and unreliable... Basically, you know how your phone has internet? You can get a thing that uses the same kind of internet, but for your house. You could also use your phone itself to supply your pc and consoles and stuff with internet

Wireless internet is something I didn't know existed until I almost got a job at a company that does it. Basically, instead of using wires, this uses two dishes that communicate with each other wirelessly. The upside is that you don't need to lay cables. The company I was looking at was mostly covering a bunch of farms that are too far from each other to make cables cost effective. The down side is you need line of sight from your house to an antenna the company has up. ([found it on Wikipedia under ""fixed wireless ""](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_wireless))",0

You need to have a place to sleep, so bed (or at least mattress or even a cot so you're not just sleeping on the floor), bedclothes like sheets, blankets and the like.

Hygiene to clean yourself (soap, shampoo, towels, toothbrush/paste, etc) as well as your place (broom, surface cleaners for kitchen and bathroom, at least a shitty vacuum if you have carpets, at least a shitty mop for the hard floors, etc).

"A care package is generally just a package of things you think the person needs or wants. Generally, this includes your favorite chocolates and treats. Sometimes, they'll include stuff like warm socks or gloves. If you're somewhere cold, or in winter. 

People who move to another country will often get these themed with things the new country don't sell (like specific types of chocolate). People who move out and into dorm rooms often get these because they don't tend to have the most money so sending them straight up food is sometimes the best way to make sure they're eating and not wasting all their money on booze. 

""care package"" could mean just about anything. An parent could put together a care package to their daughter who is coming into her periods. Including period products, maybe a safe-sex brochure and condoms. Stuff that would be incredible embarrassing for the daughter to get from their parents so they can just leave it in their bedroom and pretend it never happened

"Capturing footage during the atomic bomb tests in the 1940s and 1950s was indeed a challenging and risky task.   
  
The cameras were placed at a considerable distance from the blast to minimize the impact of the explosion and radiation. Remote-controlled cameras were often used to capture footage from safer locations.  
  
The camera operators and equipment were often shielded with lead or other radiation-blocking materials to reduce exposure to harmful radiation.  


Special high-speed cameras were used to capture the rapid events of the explosion. These cameras could record at thousands of frames per second, allowing for the capture of slow-motion footage.  
  
 Film stock used for these tests was often thicker than standard film to make it more resistant to damage from radiation and heat.  
  
Film rolls were quickly retrieved from the testing area after the explosion to minimize exposure to radiation.  
  
While the cameras and film were exposed to significant radiation and other hazards, the precautions taken, along with the use of specialized equipment, allowed for the capture of valuable footage that contributed to our understanding of nuclear weapons and their effects. However, it's worth noting that some footage may have been damaged or degraded due to radiation exposure, and not all cameras survived intact.",0

"It sounds like you have pretty bad insomnia, much worse than me, so my advice might not be that helpful but here it is anyway.

I’ve also been recommended to try all the things that you have been, and I found that none of them worked. But there were two reasons for that - one is that I was only trying one/a few of them in isolation, and the other is that I didn’t stick with them for long enough before having a bad nights sleep and despairing again. The key to this is without a doubt consistency. Do ALL of these things, EVERY day, and you will likely see results. The things I found most helpful were:

- wake up/go to bed at the same time every day, even weekends
- exercise every day
- don’t eat too late
- sleep in a slightly colder room (this has a scientific basis)
- absolutely no caffeine (very hard when you’re sleep deprived I know)
- practise mindfulness in bed (and even during the day). Often the main thing keeping me up is my thoughts, and I can’t shut down even when I go to bed. It’s counterintuitive, but I need to focus really hard on not thinking about anything, so that my brain is free to shut down. I find it helpful to count backwards from 10 in slow, deep breaths, and mentally onto noting when you mind wanders. Look this up and find something that works for you though.

Results

Fights per game decreased from a peak of 0.64 in 2002 to a low of 0.18 in 2020, while average attendance increased from a low of 16,549 in 2004 to a peak of 17,768 in 2013, before settling between 17,400 and 17,500 during the final three seasons of the study period. A significant negative correlation was found between attendance and fights per game (R = −0.6617, p = 0.0020). There was a positive, but not significant correlation between attendance and goals per game (R = 0.2457, p = 0.3105). A significant inverse correlation existed between goals per game and fights per game (R = −0.521, p = 0.0222).

Conclusions

NHL fighting rates have diminished during the past two decades, while fan attendance has increased. A significant negative correlation exists between fan attendance and fights per game, casting doubt on fighting's entertainment value. Meanwhile, a significant inverse correlation was noted between goals per game and fights per game. Taken together, these findings suggest fans may prefer higher scoring and less violent competitions. We conclude by suggesting that prohibiting fights in the NHL could improve player safety without negatively impacting fan attendance.",0

"It was quite strict, it just didn't stop the terrorists.

The real security is actually going on behind the scenes. There is one important thing that 9/11 has changed: before then if somebody hijacked a plane, pilots would comply with the hijacker's demands because passenger safety was the most important thing. Now that's changed, and pilots will refuse to do what a hijacker demands even if they start torturing and killing passengers.",0
"Short answer is no.

The original production would still enter public domain while the new production would get a shiny new copyright.  Either they re-release the original which does nothing or they re-make the original which is a novel work with it's own separate copyright.

Making new versions ""extends"" the copyright because the new versions are what people will grow up experiencing and that's *that's* what would drive their creative efforts, not the original which they've never seen.  But I've never actually heard that as a motivation before.  

What I have heard is *contracts,* not copyright.  Often times a company buys the exclusive rights to an intellectual property for a period of time and they're either looking to cash in right before the contract ends or the contract requires them to be actively developing the intellectual property or they lose it.

"There are a few things to consider when trying to make friends. The first is that not everyone is looking to be your friend, which is their own loss, if you can handle a bit of rejection it makes everything a lot easier. 

Another is that you have to make different friends for different scenarios, not everyone feels comfortable with new things (You wouldn't want to make a gaming friend and force them to go for a hike if they had no interest in it).

But to answer your actual question and break it down into steps:

1. Think of interests you have that others may share, no matter how small or big.
2. Try to find a situation where a group of people that have that interest would be together.
3. Go to that meetup or group and try talking to people about the interest, and be honest about being there to make new friends.
4. If you are having an actual conversation (as in all participants are talking, including yourself, try to add to the conversation.) then ask the person for their contact details
5. Continue chatting to the person, they're now your friend.

For example, I like cultures and languages:

When I see anyone that is foreign, I ask them where they're from.

If I know any of their language I try to say hello to them in that and tell them that I have been looking for new friends to help me practice speaking (insert language).

If I don't know their language I ask if they can teach me how to say ""hello, thank you and goodbye"" then I tell them that I'd like to learn more if they'd be willing.

Then I would introduce myself and say my name and ask them questions to get to know them, their name, their age, what their hobbies are (looking for other overlap). And giving them time to respond and ask a questions. If they are asking questions back, then odds are you've made a new friend, if not they could just be shy around strangers so you can offer up information about yourself so that they're more comfortable feeling like they know you.

I can then ask them if they're willing to give me any form of communication: phone number, snapchat, discord, email, fax, pager, whatever. And they can decide what the most comfortable form of communication would be.

&#x200B;

Another example for me as a gamer:

If there was a local convention or competition, then I could go to that, participate and between panels/games try to chat to people. Most gamers don't mind giving out their usernames to party up in the future, so it's okay to ask pretty much instantly ask someone what platform they play on and if they're looking for new friends.

&#x200B;

I feel like all of my suggestions are a little bit extroverted, so I'll give an example now on how to make friends as a gamer without leaving your house, and another method that can be applied to any hobby, but I'll again use gaming as an example.

For matchmaking games, you can just let yourself randomly fill and try to make conversation with your randoms, then ask them if they'd like to continue playing in the future and add them to your friends list.

For any hobby, you can go on a forum, or the subreddit, find people posting and if you comment on the posts and share your opinions and try to make a conversation with someone. For gaming personally I would use discord and try to find a server related specifically to the game, then I'd make conversation with the people in that server, and try to learn about them.",0

My spouse and I met outside of a punk show in 2014. We didn’t get together until early 2018. In the span of that time we were friends and were close but there wasn’t feelings until later on.

"I'm a dual citizen, Swiss and Greek (I grew up in Switzerland).

Dad's side: grandma comes from Greece, grandpa comes from Switzerland. They met when my grandpa traveled to Greece as a young lad. My dad was born and grew up there but later they moved (back) to Switzerland.

Mom's side: Both grandparents were born in Switzerland. My grandpa's parents were Germans though who immigrated to Switzerland shortly before WWI broke out. My grandma also had a German ancestor, a grandfather who immigrated to Switzerland in the 1870s. He was an ivory carver by trade (yes, that was a job back then). In Interlaken he opened a shop where he sold beautiful figurines and little statues which he had carved out of ivory. The shop was very successful, so he expanded it to sell other goods from far-away places such as exotic spices, fruits, rice etc.. In German this was called a ""Kolonialwarenladen""; literally a shop which sold various goods from European colonies in Africa, Southeast Asia etc..

I think the biggest affect my ancestry has on me are the vastly different socio-economic levels my parents' families come from. My mom's family was fairly affluent. Not rich but differently well-off. My maternal grandparents could afford a lot of things that other people in the 1950s/1960s couldn't, such as going on vacation every year, buying a vacation home abroad, buying their own motoryacht (it was small but still) etc.. My dad's family comes from extremely, unfathomably poor backgrounds. My paternal grandma grew up during WWII in Greece (Nazi occupation) and right after that was over, Greece was thrown into a bloody, horrific civil war. My grandpa, even though he comes from Switzerland, also grew up in an extremely poor family. His parents both died at a young age because they constantly ate moldy food (they couldn't afford to buy fresh food). His father was also an abusive alcoholic.

I think these vastly different, socio-economic backgrounds have made me hyper-aware of issues pertaining to inequality, poverty etc. (hence my username). From looking at my own family background, I can see how wrong people are who claim that wealth/poverty has something to do with how hard you work or how smart you are. This is nothing but Protestant propaganda. In reality, 95% of it comes down to pure luck. My paternal grandma is a very smart woman. She was simply unlucky to be born in war-torn Greece. She ended up doing manual labor her entire life but maybe if she had grown up in an affluent family in Switzerland, she would've attended university and may have had a very prosperous career. Likewise, my German ancestor who worked as an ivory carver was simply lucky that ivory was so popular during the Belle Epoque (1860-1914). In essence, he was a craftsman like carpenters or goldsmiths etc.. Nothing bad but also nothing outstanding. He became a very successful businessman and I'm sure that was partially due to his intelligence and his great talent but he was also simply lucky.",0

"Coca-Cola was losing market share to Pepsi steadily, and wanted to find a way to destroy their competitor. So in 1985, they released New Coke, a reformulation of their soft drink. They were going off of two statistics (spoiler alert: both will have plot twists).

The first statistic was that in blind-taste tests, participants preferred Pepsi to Coke. So Coca-Cola thought they needed to switch things up.

The second statistic was that after Coca-Cola came up with the new formula, in tests, participants preferred New Coke's taste over Pepsi.

So, New Coke should have been a smashing success, right? It should have taken over the market by storm and scored a huge victory for Coca-Cola over Pepsi, right?

Quite the contrary, New Coke was a massive failure.

Both statistics, as it turns out, tell a different story upon examination. The first is probably quite well-known. Pepsi is preferable when participants are asked about the tastes very quickly after tasting. It's sweeter, so at first, people like it better than Coke. But Coke is preferred if you wait a bit longer.

As for the second, take a guess why people weren't a fan.

Turns out, the wrong question was asked. Instead of asking if people liked New Coke better than Pepsi, they should have asked if people liked New Coke better than the original Coke.",0

You gotta Give Barotrauma or Project Zomboid a try. Both incredible and I depth games with their own themes. They’ve been growing in popularity and are just as fun to play either in solo or multiplayer and feature massive (and I mean massive) workshop and community support.

If you have the money, give Binding of Isaac: Rebirth a try. I say that because you need all the DLCS, not one. It’s scummy and the game won’t work otherwise but it’s simply massive as a rogue like. Over I think 400 times with All DLCs, 20+ areas/biomes, secrets for days, easy to pop up anywhere and is guaranteed to capture a minimum of 20 minutes if you want boss rush.

Lastly, give “Not Tonight” or “Dave the diver” a try. I won’t speak too much but they’re very fun a well crafted games. 

I hope you find something fun mate.",0

This time, we're getting ahead of it, realizing that space would probably be a major battleground in a modern conflict with anybody with space capabilities, and establishing a branch for it. 

Because the fact is, if we're going up against somebody else with orbital assets, not only will there likely be some form of warfare going on up there, but the stakes for humanity's future in space travel are very high.

"Just for some background and clarity: My mother did not raise me, my grandparents did while she partied with friends and put no effort into actually having myself and my brother in her life. But to hear her tell it, she was forced into giving us up. I remember quite clearly her *choosing* to leave us everytime she did. 

Years ago when I was 15, she begged me to come live with her. Told me all these fun things would happen, I would have my own room and we would build a relationship. Well I was a fucking fool because all I ended up being used for was a babysitter to her then boyfriends kids while she lived her life...as usual. I was subjected to emotional abuse, threats of physical violence and having to build up her ego every. single. day. 

Fast forward through her fucking me over numerous times in ways that no loving parent could fathom. I'm 28, I don't need a mother's comfort. I never had it so I accepted that I never will. It's all good.

But I'm going through a crisis in life, due to separating from my kid's father so her and I have moved back in together. Things are mostly *okay* but the older she gets the more pathetic she gets and I don't know how to just pretend like it isn't happening. Firstly, she's a severe alcoholic who claims she drinks because she *wants* to and that it's nobody's business even though her demeanor changes and she'll just pass out wherever she's at, no matter who's around or what she has planned. Secondly, she brags so bad about how her shit is together and she pays her bills but she has *always* begged other people for money and she even acts like she is going to claim one of my kids because her stupid ass refuses to have federal taxes taken from her checks. She claims she can't afford to pay taxes. Well bitch, if you can't pay taxes then you can't afford to buy that $100 worth of beer a week can you? And third but not last, she's fucking boy crazy. On the phone with men all day, everyday. Even guys she doesn't know she will talk about them as if she has known them her whole life. She legitimately has no type because basically anybody who gives her attention will get attention from her. She's messed with guys younger than me. She messes with married men, men in jail and acts as if it's a flex because they'd rather talk to her than their own wives. I told her they are losers, nothing more. She'd rather argue with this one guy who is the same age as me than just stop fucking with him. It's so stupid and anytime I bring logical to her attention she immediately goes on the defensive.""What's wrong with me doing...blah blah blah"" and I'm like 'nothing's *wrong* per say but what exactly are you getting out of it?' To which she either can't or is unwilling to dig deep enough to answer that. 

But here lately she's been driving me crazy. She had one of her coworkers over and he was flirting with *ME*, barely even talking to her. Once he left she acted as if he was flirting with *HER*. She was sitting there drinking the whole time him and I were talking so I don't see how she came to the conclusion that things went a certain way. 

Anyway, we live in a nice neighborhood directly across the street from my daughter's elementary school. There's a 30 year old guy next door who stays with his mother. She thinks he's cute, she only knows his name, but acts as if they actually know each other. She makes a point to walk outside half dressed as much as she can to try and get his attention. It's clear that he's uninterested in her old hoe ass but she tries harder and harder everyday. Yesterday she literally changed her shorts before walking her dog, so that half her asscheeks were hanging out. It's so classless and disgusting. Just be the 50 year old grandmother that you are. You've spent my entire life being this way and it has literally got you nowhere.

I don't think these things would bother me so much if she didn't always walk around thinking everybody wanted her, or patting herself on the back for the tiniest accomplishments. She doesn't even give other people the credit and appreciation they deserve for making *her* life easier. She wants to tell people how they should look, but says that no one is going to tell her anything. It oozes low self esteem, the need for validation and just not having any real personality.

I cannot find a single admirable quality about this bitch other than her being here for me in this one period in my life. But even now, I hear her on the phone over exaggerating her part to get praise from others. 

How in the fuck do I cope with this, without wanting to explode on her ass?",0

Talking maybe sound like its worthless sometimes, but if you’re ever struggling, having someone to simply talk to can make all the difference. You need to get the shit out of your head and vocalize it, for your own benefit. 
A good friend is invaluable… but if you dont, and most of us don’t. I’d recommend getting in touch with a community support group, a phone line thing, or chat to your Dr. (Im aussie and Dr’s are cheap here) 
Find somewhere that lets you call and chat to someone when you need, or meet up, and just talk bro.

This allows you to process what you just learned.

The important thing is to make the backtracking worth the players time! Going back to the flamethrower, while backtracking to the vines, say you run into an enemy you thought was tough to deal with using your normal gun. Well, now you have a flamethrower, which is going to be way more effective. This helps you understand the combat applications of the new weapon. Then you get into the exploration applications, burning down blockages, and you find upgrades, then eventually you clear the story roadblock, get to Area Y, and you're in the new content!

The story is great and teaches you all the ins and outs. Ship control is great, solid handling, and at any point in the mission you can control how much power goes to weapons/engines/shields, and you can even focus shields forwards or backwards. 

I play in VR and it's amazing sitting in the cockpit and watching tie fighters as they fly past you. Very immersive. Highly recommend it in VR if you have the opportunity.",0
"Not quite the same but I had a friend that would always lose at Mario Kart Double dash and Smash Bros and once it was certain he wouldn’t win he would walk across the room and go “Oops finger slipped.” And turn off the GameCube.

">  You ~~never~~ see your character ~~at all during the game hardly except~~ in menus or riding a motorcycle in cyberpunk.

Sometimes, for me, just knowing I look a certain way is enough. If I can see myself in my full loadout in a menu, I'm good. 

I do understand your frustration with it. It's nice when you can see your character during dialogs, a la Baldur's Gate 3. But even though you don't really see yourself in Cyberpunk, I'm glad I have the option to customise and create... even if it is a little pointless.",0

"Nah I think most of them mean it in a different way. Kinda like style and aesthetic is more important than pursuing photo-realistic graphics.

Lots of Nintendo folks roasted Nin and Gamefreak for latest Pokemon games looking as PS2 shit and playing at 10 fps. They also always appreciate good looking games even in the tech regard. See things like Super Mario Wonder, ToTK, Peach game or Links Awakening remake, people constantly talk about how crisp and eye-candy those games look.

Graphics clearly matter to them in the way that they also want high resolution, more pixels in Mario's stache, great artsyle, etc, on top of stable and good performance.

I don't think there're Nintendo fans out there who are happy with how things like MK1 look and want more ugly shit looking and running like early alpha prototype N64 games. Lots of them just don't mind or love the cartoony look to those games and don't need Nintendo to crate smth like TLoU 2 with photo-realisitc faces and blood-splatters. But I'm sure they want Nin to eventually get into territory of games like Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart aka gimme 4k\\60fps Mario with Ray Tracing looking better than any animated movie ever would.",0

"Every iteration of id Software's technology is exactly that - an iteration. They'll call it different names, have parts rewritten whole, but I do not believe Carmack ever started on a blank piece of paper after Quake 1's engine. The same goes for the Unreal engine, which I'm pretty sure was iterated upon time and time again all the way back to its original version. 

But, if every line of code is at some point rewritten into another, is it still ""the old engine""? I've never considered that to be the case.",0

"Kinda, punishes are an easy concept to convert. In any game with guns, shotguns typically have a much longer reload and delay between shots, get them to whiff their shot and while they're reloading bully them, if you've ever played sea of thieves this is functionally the only way to board from the ladder without getting extremely lucky.

Option selects or OS are little tougher, (for the uninformed it's a concept in fighting games where you structure your input so you have an initial desired outcome but incase something else happens you get an input that functionally covers that, like teaching grabs with lights so if they don't grab you just smack them and if they grab you just tech out immediately). Depending on how you think about pause buffering as an option select then it's used all the times in speed runs, other than that I guess pinning a piece in chess is technically a super slow paced OS. I'm going to need help from people more familiar with other genres as that concept doesn't apply as cleanly as the reason why they work in fighting games, don't really exist frequently in other genres.",0

"> As a Unity employee until this morning, I assure you we fought like hell against this, brought up all the points everyone has, were told answers were coming, and then the announcement went out without warning, Those of us who care are out — more resignations coming end of week.""

What is amazing is that Unity heard the concern their own staff had and released the statement without answering their own questions on how this would all work.

With mobile developers switching engines, and staff leaving its going to be impossible for Unity to survive after this.

He also posted this just a few minutes ago:

> I wish we didn't have to say this, but wow - death threats are never ok. I've spent most of today on video/text with (now/imminently former) friends at unity about the threats, and the fee and blowback, and... just can't imagine a way this whole thing could've been more fucked",0

"I have been reading old murder mysteries from Gutenberg(dot)org.   Books out of copyright, published before 1927 (?).

For those youngsters who think everything revolves around DNA, these books show how their authors thought their fictional detectives would solve crimes without it.  

As an example search for Freeman Wills Crofts, they have four of his books.  For most of these authors Gutenberg only has one or two of their books.",0

"Don’t think that people appreciate the damage done in a collision like this. When I was hit off my bike, there was glass, plastic and paint debris in the road for days after. The blood stains I left were still visible on the tarmac two weeks after, even though we had several rainstorms in that time. Any police force looking for a lost child is almost certain to notice the site of a collision, once you’ve realised how to spot them, it’s impossible to not see them as you drive around",0
"The graffiti was dipshit kids trolling adults and getting them wound up over ""SATAN!!"". I grew up in this area and teens left this type of graffiti around for years afterward. It was pretty traumatic for the community, Halloween that year was basically cancelled, kids were scared to go anywhere, GenXers that grew up there had real lasting damage from it. I think it was someone either local or attached to Hill Air Force Base. The area she was found was sort of out of the way (now a beautiful 4 lane scenic byway), mainly locals used it to get to a reservoir, a ski area, and hunting areas. The playground was not really visible from the road, it was set behind the school with houses on either side and a canal then fence and trees and a 4 lane highway on the east side (google map Doxey Elementary, Sunset UT). It hasnt changed too much in 30 years.
Local police were completely unprepared for that type of crime and did a terrible job. A year or so ago there were some new stories and info from her brother but nothing ever came of it. I felt terrible for her mother, she was just hollowed out by the trauma.",0

I’m curious if there were defensive wounds, blood under her nails, etc. Why was the husband allowed to fuck with the crime scene? We may have questions we’ll never get the answer to. Sounds like horribly botched, negligent, and maybe even corrupt police work that lead to her killer remaining free.",0

Obviously we’ll never know what that was all about since neither of them is alive and could tell the story. Everything about it seems off though.",0
"This comment section is going to be a mess, but I'll still go ahead and say that this prosecution is a waste of everyone's time and money. Prosecuting women who were frightened children themselves when they gave birth is not a good use of state resources.",0

"Thanks for sharing, I find mysteries like this really interesting.

If I had to hazard a guess, this is what might have happened:

- Some early settler during westward expansion (or someone who came later but is transient, like a trapper etc) makes a camp or winter cabin there
- it ends up being known in the area as Last Chance Cabin. maybe at one point it was the last shelter for X miles if you're following the Pass Creek Pass to the west or whatever.
- when maps are made of the area, it either ends up on the map as a known local point of interest, or is added later as a known location. the adjacent creek is named after the cabin, either because it wasn't mapped before or just didn't have a name.
- some time later, settler or trapper moves on, leaving the cabin abandoned. the building remains and is a known landmark. OR, the settler or locals dismantles the cabin to re-use the lumber, but the cabin's location remains on maps and as a known landmark to locals.
- Colville National Forest is established in 1907. Last Chance Cabin is still a known landmark in the area, or at least appears on available maps, so it's included in maps produced by the forestry service and in lists of known points.
- if it wasn't already dismantled, I'd imagine that the forestry service would have razed or dismantled the abandoned cabin at some point after the forest is established. maybe they reused the lumber for fencing or makeshift bridges, or the clearing as a camp or staging area while they cleared Development Road 400 (right next to the point on the map). it wouldn't be hard for time and heavy use of the site to erase any remaining traces of the cabin. especially considering it's over 100 years since the forest was established, and especially-especially if there was any effort taken to restore the site to nature after use.
- Either nobody at the forestry service realizes that there is no more last chance cabin, OR Last Chance Cabin ends up used as a way to reference ""that clearing we stage equipment in off of Road 400"", so it is not removed from the map.
- now we're at the present day - the existence of Last Chance Cabin has percolated through public data published by the forestry service into a ton of different GIS databases and maps, which are then scraped and re-used by a thousand other maps and websites, which then get scraped... etc. None of these sources care or realize that there is no cabin at Last Chance Cabin.

Do you have any pictures of the site? Even if the cabin is entirely gone and has left no trace I'd imagine there would be evidence of a clearing - no trees, or noticeably younger trees, etc.",0

"Texas Rangers Cold Case Investigation Details

  Arellano Family

REFERENCE NUMBER: 256 - Unsolved
COMPANY: D
RACE: Hispanic
SEX: Unknown
CITY:
COUNTY: Edwards
RELATED YEAR: 1968

DETAILS:

On April 16, 1968, the Arellano family (Juan, 29; Monica, 24; Rosa, 21; Eduardo, 1; Leticia, 2; and Manuel Jr., 5) were traveling from Mexico to San Angelo, Texas to meet with family members. Their car broke down, with a flat tire. Sometime after that, five (5) members of the family were murdered in rural Edwards County, south of Sonora, Texas. Their bodies were located near Highway U.S. 277. The victims had been shot, stabbed, beaten and Rosa had been sexually assaulted. Leticia died at the hospital two days later. The sole survivor of the incident was Manuel Arellano Jr. Over the years, multiple leads have been followed without success. This case remains one of the most heinous, unsolved, mass murders in Texas. As of this time, no pictures of the family are available. The victims were traveling in a white over blue, 1958 Buick, as seen in this photograph.

According to a Standard-Times report from April 18, 1968, a massive manhunt was organized right away. The hunt for an unknown killer was underway in the sparsely-set countryside north of Del Rio, following the discovery of four victims of an apparent mass murder. The ghastly crime scenes were difficult to sort out, even for experienced officers. In the days following the deaths, more information was released by officials, who called the slayings “a sadistic bloodbath.” Babies were stabbed and beaten, a teenage girl stripped naked, apparently raped and then killed – and a helpless mother and father either bludgeoned, shot or stabbed to death. No apparent death weapon has been found by law officers 2.

Pete Gomez Sr., who in 1968 was working for the Highway Department on a project to widen the road where the murders took place, has erected a memorial marker on U.S. Highway 277 about 34 miles south of Sonora to honor the victims of this unsolved killing spree 2.",0

His home in 2019 when I last visited was a showhome. Now, it is in disrepair. Lots of fleas, carpet behind the TV covered in cat excrement. He was in debt for 1000s of pounds. His bedroom had loose wires and bugs. Just absolutely sad. I managed to clean the bathroom and emptied some stuff out (towels that were no good and lots of used / empty toiletries and cleaning product). Just sad. Why didn't he tell either of us he was struggling? It really breaks my heart. His ex and the kids are really feeling it. It's hit me hard too.",0
Cool mystery and great write up,0
"The local media reported that his destination was a hunting camp near Buchans. 

For those unfamiliar with the area, Newfoundland is a big island, with one highway running the length of it. The island is accessible by ferry at its southwestern point, and the road runs north then east. Buchans is a small and remote inland town which is accessible by highway from the central part of the island of Newfoundland. To get there from the ferry crossing, you have to drive almost a hairpin shaped route that’s about six hours. 

I tested Google Maps the other day [for directions from Stephenville on Newfoundlands west coast, to Buchans](https://imgur.io/a/WF9IZRG) and to my surprise it suggests two routes. Even though there’s only one actual road to get there. The secondary route Google recommended isn’t a road at all. It’s probably an old logging road or something, but it definitely isn’t a maintained route. From the sounds of the news article, the secondary route is where he turned off, and he made it an impressive distance along a road that isn’t a road until his truck could go no further. Unfortunately there’s nothing around that area, no settlements, and no reason why anyone else would be there. It’s truly the middle of nowhere. He probably tried walking in search of help and died lost in the wilderness. 

As to why he wound up there, my guess is that GPS made this seem like a shorter and viable route, and he followed it longer than common sense would have indicated.",0

"Just to play devil's advocate, here is a skeptic's look at the case. According to Dunning, the stories grew and became more embellished as time went on, and if we go by the reported accounts at the time of the sighting there seem to be more prosaic and plausible explanations for this event, rather than a flying saucer: [https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4208](https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4208)

What do you think?",0
"There are three main theories I would like to present, though this is not an exhaustive list and anyone is welcome to take a stab at what happened. My top three theories are:

1. Joan staged her disappearance. Her accomplice was likely an affair partner who was driving the mystery vehicle. This theory is best supported by Joan’s library history. It was also found that Joan’s parents died in a mysterious fire when she was young, and that Joan may have been a victim of childhood sexual abuse. Investigators thought was suspicious and may have motivated her to stage her disappearance if she were unhappy. It is also possible that her affair partner* murdered her after a disagreement prior to running away.
2. There was significant construction around Joan’s neighborhood that summer, which brought in many out of town men. It is quite possible that someone staked out the Risch residence and found that her husband was away. This is especially consistent with the milkman’s sighting of the mystery vehicle on the morning of Joan’s disappearance while she was out getting groceries. The police did question three construction workers they thought were suspicious, as well as their manager, but were unable to prove anything. 
3. Finally, what I personally believe to be the most likely theory: Joan was the victim of a botched home abortion. At the time, abortion was illegal and frowned upon. The presence of beer bottles in the trash may have indicated alcohol was used to calm the nerves. The phone ripped off the wall and thrown in the trash while the phone book was open to emergency numbers might indicate that whoever provided Joan with the abortion physically prevented her from calling for assistance for fear of the consequences. Finally, the unconfirmed sightings of Joan are consistent with a woman losing blood from an internal injury and becoming disoriented. Given Joan and her husband’s social standing at the time, she may have been hesitant to ask people in the community (such as her neighbors) for help. It is also possible that the person providing the abortion was Joan’s affair partner*, which would explain the necessity of the abortion as well as why it was botched (as this person probably wasn’t a professional).

*note that mentions of Joan’s affair partner are speculative and unconfirmed",0

Alfredo’s story sounds fishy and I wouldn’t be surprised if he was at least somehow involved. It pains me that almost 30 years later the police have nothing to pin him or anyone else for the crime.

"I remember this. Anecdotally, I saw so many dead birds while walking my dog during 2021. It was deeply upsetting. One was actually a red tailed hawk and that really got me. The cicadas definitely seemed like a big clue at the time - I'd heard that it might be related to pesticides the cicadas had been exposed to/ingested while underground and that birds eating the cicadas were exposing themselves to toxic, highly concentrated, levels of chemicals. But pure conjecture and clearly the events weren't isolated to cicadas (and research seems to suggest that there weren't spiking levels of toxins). 

On a more positive note, the birds in my area seem to have rebounded this year and I haven't come across nearly as many dead ones. (The ones I've seen were clearly killed by cats, which is a whole other soapbox I won't get onto right now.)",0

you're right, it could've been damn near anyone, especially with easy access from the interstate. i wish we knew more about kelly's life at the time, the circumstances of her disappearance, and how she was identified. was she abducted? was she hitch-hiking? is there any evidence she may have known and trusted her killer? what happened to her child and fiance/ex-fiance (since they were seemingly never married?) what belongings – if any – did she have on her person when she was found? it seems so odd minnesota investigators never released an established timeline in order to get leads. 

why do investigators believe the prisoner serving 200 years for serial rape but no murders killed her? surely she would not have been his only murder victim?

In short, dad claimed to be neighbors to the Raders and that Dennis's younger brother (Jeff) liked to torture/kill small animals.

"Have to admit i'm a dull skeptic who typically goes for the most likely scenario so mind will likely be uninteresting compared to the more out there theories.

The one that comes to mind is Peter Bergmann was attempting to create a famous mystery like Isdal Woman or Taman Shud with his death. For those who don't know ""Peter Bergmann"" is a John Doe whose body was found on a beach in Ireland. His case is constantly compared to the former two because he went to lengths to hide his identity, giving fake addresses, cutting tags from his clothing, etc. However he was seriously unwell with advanced prostate cancer and other tumours. I think he knew he was dying and he was a mystery buff who was familiar with those cases so he wanted to create his own mysterious death to be remembered. Sadly in that case he was likely a lonely man with little relations or he would figure he would be identified quickly since i'm sure he figured his case would be huge which sadly it isn't really.

I realize there's much more likely scenarios but that's genuinely what i believe in that case until he's identified at least.

She was hounded as a bad mother, a murderer and was mocked mercilessly with ""A dingo ate my baby!"" taunts for decades. Although convictions were quashed and compensation was paid relatively early, it wasn't until 2012 that the evidence was reviewed by a fourth coroner, which definitively agreed that Azaria was taken and killed by a dingo.

In 2021 he was arrested for her murder and his father was arrested for accessory after the fact. Police believed that he killed Kristin during a rape or attempted rape in his dorm room after the party, and then he took her body to his dad’s house where the dad helped him bury it. When police did a search they found an area under the deck that looked like it had been a shallow grave, cadaver dogs hit on it, and while they couldn’t get any DNA from the soil they did find fibers consistent with clothes Kristin was wearing when she disappeared. The father apparently never went around the area and refused to let plumbers or other workers near it either. Seems the body had been moved fairly recently to when police dug up the area.

Flores was found guilty of Kristin’s murder (his father was acquitted for accessory after the fact) and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. So they know what happened to her, just not where her body is.",0

Can he still stay with his foster family even though he has been confirmed not to be a minor? It seems he is happy with them.,0
"I don't think the person is a woman as some of you guys speculate. He looks and runs like an athletic man. The kind that does triathlons not the bulky, gym kind.

Some things I've noticed:

1. He covered the backpack logo with duct tape
2. Zero wear and tear on his clothing (see the bright white of the shoes), meaning he bought a new set of disposable garments for this only
3. White soles shoes: don't leave marks if there is a struggle
4. Dressed to run if needed
5. I feel like the limp was fake, he knew there were cameras and looking for a fake trait is a great diversion.
6. He probably pulverized sodium hypochlorite and/or similar substances on surfaces inside the apartment to destroy possible DNA traces (judging by the smell that lasted until \~5PM when the 911 call was made, the quantity/concentration was significant)
7. Seems he's in complete control **after** the crime. He only seizes the opportunity to run and catch the green light, but doesn't seem distressed, looking behind or generally more aware of his surroundings.
8. I think Scott was expecting someone, but he didn't knew exactly who. Perhaps somebody he trusted or owned a favor to told him to expect a courier or a collector. He took a day off from work to be home at **that specific hour and day**. He had to be **alone,** but his sister was living with him, so this meeting was probably risky during the weekends or evenings. It's very hard to speculate why, but it was most certainly something that he wanted to hide even from family.
9. Some people say he only wanted to have a long weekend (MLK day was Monday), but how would it be possible for the killer to known he was home at that **specific hour and day**, when his regular schedule indicated he should have been working? It was clearly a planned meeting.
10. Considering this, the suspect most probably simply just entered the building and the apartment. No mystery here, Scott let him in. I'm almost certain about that, otherwise too many things wouldn't make sense.

It seems unlikely to be a case of mistaken identity, considering how well premeditated this seems to be. Also, if somebody is willing to pay a professional, the victim must have been in some serious trouble that is not yet disclosed.",0
I’m wondering if multiple people (perhaps brothers or close relatives) have intentionally shared the same identity to work in Australia. The original person using the identity returned home and “Martin” continued to work in Australia. This would explain “Martin” having the contact info for his “Brother” and the family knowing who “Martin” really was and accepting his death initially. The later situation can be explained by the surviving family wanting to avoid getting into trouble with authorities over identity/immigration fraud.,0
"The best move would be a reward being offered for information leading to the killer. In some ways 1986 wasn't that long ago for anyone who was grown up in that decade- & it is likely the killer struck again. A tip could turn into a way to identify the killer.

Also a reward in my region for a cold case did end up helping close the case (no one collected on it, but the awareness of the reward kept the case in public conversation.)",0
"It's gruesome, but it's not uncommon for bodies in water to become dismembered during the process of decomposition, esp in actively moving waters like the ocean. As connective tissue decays, the body is exposed to scavenger predation, and the body moves with the waves and tides, it weakens and can fall apart. As I recall, Laci Peterson's body was found headless (although I may be misremembering).

Not saying the cases *aren't* related, or that they're not a result of foul play, of course.",0
"I had a thought that maybe the killer meant to target one of her sisters and killed the wrong sister. I wonder how similar they all looked?  In a dark room at night, with people under covers and siblings sharing beds, it’s possible.

Edited: looked at the pics of the newspaper clippings and wow, the news story about the 107 Fascists elected in Germany to become the second largest political party there  as a small blip accompanying the horrible murder news.

This is an excellent write up and you did a great job researching these possible victims of his. Thank you for sharing and getting their names and cases out there, regardless if they are linked to him or not. These older cases all need resolution and this is just one of the ways to make their cases known.

"Friend of the family was murdered a bit over a week ago while on a business trip by someone completely random. Witnesses say he was just a bystander walking by at the time.

"* Alcohol is involved in up to 70% of deaths associated with water recreation, like boating or swimming.
* Nearly 1 in 4 emergency department visits for drowning involve alcohol use.
About 1 in 5 reported boating deaths involve alcohol use.
* The risk of drowning is 10 times higher for people with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.10 g/dL. (That's about 3 beers, wine glasses, or shots)
* Nearly 80% of people who die from drowning are male. Many factors might contribute to higher rates of drowning among males, including increased exposure to water, risk-taking behaviors, and alcohol use.

Replace water with crazy cliffs in this scenario.

Also just because you look fine on video doesn't mean you're not shit faced. I've been brownout drunk and people had no idea.

Plenty of families and friends refuse to accept their loved one died while intoxicated. They seem to always point to some nefarious reason they're dead. But why do they often disappear after leaving the bar, instead of say, during the day when sober. 

Unless we're talking about a serial killer who targets drunk males and pushes them off cliffs twelve years apart and leaves no evidence.",0
"If the assumption that she’s had children is correct, I feel like they’re the only way this case may be solved. 1971 is a long time ago. If she was newly in America, I worry that she was isolated and that even if anyone had taken notice of her, they’ve either forgotten or passed away. If she has had children, I wonder if they’re still alive and where they are. Now that I think about it, there’s no guarantee that just because she gave birth, the children were born alive. Ach. 

That she was found wearing all her clothes makes me wonder if it was someone she knew and the motive wasn’t sexual. She even had her poncho on. I know she could have rejected someone and they could have gone right to 100, but I just wonder what her relationship was to the murderer and whether it was someone she knew well versus a stranger or person she met for the first time before her murder. 

I suppose the school and programme she was potentially involved in didn’t keep records going that far back, if it even still exists. What a frustrating case.",0

"Thanks for the writeup!

Some context: Haines is a tiny city in Alaska that had 993 residents in 1980 according to the census. If one of those residents did not commit the murder, the murderer most likely drove into Haines on the [Haines Highway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haines_Highway#Major_intersections), as the incident with the sister and the strange man who wouldn't talk to her might corroborate. Haines Highway is the only road connecting Haines to the rest of the continent's road network. It requires crossing a US-Canadian border, which was way less formal back in the 1980s but nowadays would have a video recording of every car going in and out of the country. Another possibility is that the perpetrator was a fisherman who was not a permanent resident of the city. The manner of death (strangled with fishing twine) stands out to me in support of that.

Most of what Lois Wheeler notes about the case rings true. I do think Eileen was stalked by someone local, maybe even at the motel, who made their move that night after they saw Lois leave. If the perpetrator was not a fisherman, it follows that the fishing twine was chosen in advance and was ready to go. She is also right that the case was not taken as seriously as it should have by the authorities.",0

"So, I don't want this to come across as accusing or critical of your write-up, but I feel like we should at least consider the facts that were presented to a jury. This kind of makes it sound like the argument was, ""Well, (shrug) what else could it be?"" And I completely, 100% understand the argument that the facts aren't enough to overcome reasonable doubt. I think I lean that way myself. So this comment isn't so much arguing for his guilt; I just want to make sure people understand that they weren't weighing whether or not she fell asleep in the tub.

**He claimed she was face-down in the tub.**

In his initial 911 call, he told them that she ""fell asleep"" and drowned and he ""thought she was dead."" He said he found her face down in the tub, and he had not moved her at the time he called 911. He apparently did not get her out of the tub until asked to do so. This position is not consistent with someone slipping under the water after falling asleep. And - in fact - when his family had reached out to a show after his conviction, their investigator concluded he had lied in his 911 call. Bizarrely, he told this investigator that he had found her face up, initially denying that he'd ever said she was face down. He later admitted that his initial story had her face down, but still claimed she was face up. This is an oddity that is a bit more than an ""inconsistency."" [source](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/crime/crime-and-courts/2018/07/25/new-investigation-ryan-widmer-and-his-wifes-death-hes-not-telling-truth/824852002/)

For another inconsistency, he told 911 that she falls asleep in the tub ""all the time."" After she was declared dead at the hospital, he told a detective that he ""was afraid she may fall asleep in the tub."" When the detective asked if that had ever happened before, he said, ""no, she had never fallen asleep in the tub before, but Sarah would fall asleep easily.""

**Her body was not wet. The tub was not wet. The floor was not wet.**

This is important, because it was noted by multiple people. The EMTs said her body was dry and only her hair was damp. They did not notice any pruning on her fingers. They also did not notice any damage to her fingernails and manicure. Detectives arrived at the scene as the ambulance left. They noted that the tub was not wet. It had a few water droplets around the drain, but it was otherwise dry. The towels were not wet. The floor was not wet. A magazine, a bathmat and discarded clothes lying on the bathroom floor were all dry.

A lot has been made about how her body seemed weirdly dry, and the first conviction was thrown out when it was discovered that some jurors timed how long it took their own bodies to dry after getting out of a bath. They concluded that it was impossible for that to happen in 3 and a half minutes. But this is considered a juror doing independent research, and that's why the first conviction was thrown out. [source](https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/crime--law/widmer-juror-speaks-out-about-trial/T7jiWJjy28YQALEcrRJxqJ/) Yes, this is misconduct, and it was proper that the first conviction was thrown out, but I think it's also helpful for us to understand that ""misconduct"" does not mean they were wrong about the facts. In the source listed in the previous section, a TV show also performed this test, with a woman getting out of a bath and air drying for 8 and a half minutes. She was still wet. He claims he pulled the plug on the bath tub (and didn't try to remove her or anything), and that is why she wasn't as wet. But again, he also claims he called 911 immediately, and he was unable to pick her up because she was too slippery. He also said he drained the tub during the 911 call.

In addition to everything being dry, the TV was on a different channel than the Bengals game, and there were bath products lined up on the edge of the tub. [source](https://casetext.com/case/widmer-v-warden-1)

**She had a head contusion, scalp injuries, petechial hemorrhaging in her eye, cuts to her upper lip, and deep hemorrhaging in her internal neck (and a lot of smaller abrasions and contusions, including in her armpit)**

His defense claims these were caused by CPR and intubation, and medical examiners disagree on whether neck bruising and hemorrhaging could be caused by the efforts to save her. CPR does not typically injure the neck, but they did try to intubate her. The question is whether she was alive when EMTs first arrived, I guess. For what it's worth, Emergency responders noted that she did not have a pulse and she wasn't breathing when they first arrived. He also believed she was dead when he first found her. For the CPR and intubation to cause hemorrhaging, she would still need to have been alive when they arrived. Petechial Hemorrhaging typically occurs when pressure is placed on the neck. On the other side of this, drowning victims have been resuscitated after breathing has stopped. I think this is too advanced for anyone other than medical examiners who have seen her autopsy/autopsy photos to call.

**Blood and fecal matter were found on the bedroom carpet in locations that did not match with where EMT placed her**

This is getting into the weeds a little bit, but the first responders moved her to the bedroom for treatment. \[Edit, correction here, first responders never saw her in the bathroom. Widmer had moved her body to the bedroom before they arrived. The first person on the scene found her lying on the bedroom floor, her body was warm and dry, but her hair was wet. She had no pulse and wasn't breathing. He also did not notice any clear external injuries, though\]. When investigators went back to take samples from the area, there was blood and fecal matter in the area where her head had been laid. Fecal matter was also found in a different area, near where she was laid, but not exactly there. The blood is pretty easy to explain, because first responders also noted frothy blood leaking from her mouth while giving her treatment. Fecal matter is a different story, though. There was no fecal matter found near where her genitals would have been when she received treatment. I'm not sure if this is where the theory came about that he drowned her in the toilet. I gather it wasn't used at his last trial, but I'm only getting that from some of his assertions in his appeal. The other possibility is that a violent event started in the bedroom and then moved to the bathroom. \[edit: Or that she didn't actually die in the bathroom at all, but rather after she had already left the bath.\]

I've not seen what his Defense makes of this piece of evidence.

**He was visiting Adult Friend Finder before her death**

I normally wouldn't mention this, because someone looking at porn is not a motive to kill a spouse. But Adult Friend Finder is not just porn; it is also used to hook up with real people. Luckily, his Defense was successful in prohibiting this from being shown at trial, so the juries were unaware of this. The prosecution couldn't prove that Sarah knew he was trying to hook up with people on the site, so they were not allowed to present it as evidence. I only bring this up because the OP mentions that he was only seeking out other women 2 years after her death. There is evidence to the contrary. But it was correctly prohibited from his trial.

Now, does all of this overcome reasonable doubt? I'm not sure. Again, I didn't write this comment to argue for his guilt, even though it may appear that way. It's more that I wanted a fuller story for how 3 separate juries were unable to arrive at a not-guilty verdict. Even with these facts, I'm not sure I could overcome reasonable doubt in a court of law, though it would be interesting to read the trial transcripts. But a lot of the comments here seem to think this is about whether or not someone can fall asleep and drown in the tub. The juries heard a very different set of facts. It's not so much that they couldn't think of any other explanation. It's that he was ""inconsistent"" on some material, basic facts. The physical evidence didn't match his description of events, and her injuries were more than some light bruising in her neck.",0

"I was able to see a few previews of archived articles from the Clarksville, TN Leaf-Chronicle, and was able to make out “To a visitor, the Montgomery County Girls Home seems [more like] a college dorm than a home [for run]aways, unruly girls, and the [victims of?] abuse and neglect.” If anyone has a newspapers.com subscription, you’ll be able to read the articles. 

ETA: I think her birth announcement (from 1965) and possibly a “community announcements”-type post about her second birthday (1967) are in there as well, which I found after searching for her name. 

2nd edit: I remembered I have a third email address I haven’t used for a subscription yet! The 1967 article is announcing that “little Linda Sue Karnes, from Cleveland, Ohio, is making her home with her great-grandmother, Elsie Karnes.” and then goes on to list everyone that’s been visiting the house. I wonder what happened to cause her to have to live with her great grandmother.

3rd edit: She was in 4H and showed chickens in 1977, was on the hospital list the next year. She had an older brother named Ricky (may have been only a year older—first reference to him was less than a year before she was born, and he’s referred to as “baby Ricky”). It appears that he ended up living with the Baggett family (I think they’re related—in the great grandmother’s obituary, there were something like 22 grandchildren, 30 great grandchildren, and 12 great great grandchildren, so it was a very large family), while she was with the great grandmother —Elsie. Her father, Richard, was still alive as of 1993, and was living in Granite CIty, IL at that time. Searches of Madison county papers don’t bring up anything, though.",0
"This is my first time hearing of this case. Per the links, Jack and Dwayne fell out of contact with seemingly everyone on October 22, and this was out of character enough for Dwayne’s mom Cookie to go looking for them October 25th, after which she was never seen again. Now Cookie and Dwayne were found buried at the same site.

Obviously more information will come out but my immediate thought is that this sounds like some weird Al Kite-esque situation and Cookie surprised the killer(s). Baffling scenario though for sure.

> Dewayne and Jack Grimes planned to go to a horse show in Dallas and buy a horse but never showed. When Cookie heard that, she went to the police Monday morning to file a missing person’s report.

> Police needed Dewayne's social security number so Cookie decided to drive to Turley to Jack and Dewayne's house, get Dewayne's card and come home the same day. It was supposed to be a simple two-hour trip.

> When Cookie didn't come home, [her daughter] Donna and her husband went looking for her Tuesday but got no answers. They were reluctantly headed back home when they saw Cookie's car on the side of the highway.

> “The ignition was popped and the key was in the ignition. She never used the key, never ever used the key and her pepper spray was laying in the seat and it's always connected to her purse,"" said Donna.

> She said Cookie's car was always a mess; filled with books, CDs, and gloves. But this time, the car was spotless.

> **They called investigators, who found a video of Cookie taking one of Jack and Dewayne's newest ranch hands** to the Reasor’s in Owasso, showing Cookie's pepper spray hanging from her purse.

> That trip makes no sense to Donna because her mother never drove after dark because of her eyesight.

> She said **Jack was known for giving a helping hand to someone who was homeless, or an addict, or down on their luck.**

> **”He'd been there about two months before this happened. My brother said he just felt sorry for him and, do a few chores and we'll let you stay in the barn,"" Donna said.**

> She said **the ranch hand had access to the house to shower and do laundry.** The food he and Cookie bought in Owasso was still in Jack and Dewayne's refrigerator.

> Donna said there was only one phone number on Cookie's bill they didn't recognize. It was called right before the trip to Reasor’s and right afterward, to a homeless camp in Tulsa.",0

"So, my hometown has a riverfront park with a small boardwalk and a little trail along the water. Lots of drinking goes on there, teens and homeless people hang out in this park and there have been a few “mysterious” incidents where people have disappeared after hanging out in the area and later been found deceased in the water. 

When I was a teenager, my boyfriend and I were walking around down there having a drink, late at night in the summer. We heard a weird groaning and followed it to find a man lying on the ground absolutely *covered* in blood. He was lucky he hadn’t fallen in the water, he was close. So we go over and try to assess what happened, dude has a huge lump on his head and all his front teeth are busted out. He was really hard to understand and incoherent, but from what we gathered he hadn’t been assaulted, he’d tripped and fallen. I tried to search for any teeth that might be able to be put back in but didn’t find any (not sure if that’s actually possible but I tried lol) I couldn’t tell if he was drunk or just concussed, and his mouth was all fucked up…

He really, really didn’t want an ambulance because he didn’t have insurance, so we called my boyfriend’s mom to drive us to the hospital. Looking back he really could have used one considering the head injury, but I was like 16 and didn’t know. We got him inside the hospital and left when they took him back. A few weeks later, I’m reading our local free paper and see a guy wrote in, thanking the kids who drove him to the hospital after he fell and hurt himself at the boardwalk. Apparently he was indeed very drunk, fell down and busted out 5 teeth, and got a severe head injury that could have killed him if we hadn’t found him lying there at 2am. He was the owner of a local construction company, apparently he’d wandered off from his buddies at the bar (I had assumed he was a homeless guy who lived in the park, oops). But yeah, these injuries can totally happen to intoxicated people without anything nefarious going on. It’s sad this fellow hasn’t been identified, I wonder if he’s an immigrant",0

Was there clear evidence that the parts (or some of them) had been frozen and subsequently thawed? If so, I wonder if that suggests an initial, hasty concealment of the parts, or perhaps a deliberate attempt to muddy the post-mortem interval.

It's just all getting a bit boring. There's nothing to do where I live, and with severely limited finances you can't exactly hop on a train or bus as they're not that realiable. 

On a positive note, my youngest sister is over on Friday for a week stopping at mine with her two kids. I can't wait! Plus, I see one of my cousins whom is staying outside of the town the same week too.",0
"[Celina Mays](https://charleyproject.org/case/celina-janette-mays) haunts me. She was just a young kid, and someone raped* and impregnated her. Her family was highly religious, secretive, and in some cases, abusive. She lost her mother a couple of years before her disappearance, and her reportedly abusive dad got custody of her after a legal battle with her mom's family.

*Celina never said exactly who the father of her baby was, but apparently told her doctor it was a teen who attended her church. She did not imply it was forcible rape, apparently, but I'm calling it as it was - she was too young to consent, only 11 years old when the baby was conceived.",0
Thank you for keeping these babies alive with your post. I hope someday they get their names back.,0

"The thing about Mr. Boo being diabetic is another factor I was wondering about. If he wasn't accustomed to being out late (whether or not he actually had any drinks), depending on how severe his condition was, if he'd had a sugar low he might have had some trouble while going home. (One of my co-workers has diabetes, and her husband has had to search for her on a couple of occasions ... she always uses the same path and calls home before starting out, and if she's even a few minutes late he starts out in case she's having difficulties.) Someone else has already posted, about whether there might be water along the route -- ponds, canals, etc.  


The other possibility -- that someone at the Turf Club or elsewhere on his way to his workplace heard about Mr. Boo's good fortune, and decided to take advantage -- is more dismaying. They would have had to be patient and lucky though, if they were waiting to ambush him. Even if his route home was predictable. One of his friends/co-workers doing that is also possible (and especially sad.)

Also -- ""However, when the family searched the temple, they found no trace of Ah Hu, Mr Boo or his motorcycle.""   
\-- If Ah Hu was supposedly staying at the temple, I wonder where he was when Mr. Boo's family checked on him? (Though I imagine the police would have looked into that already.)",0
"A few points of clarification:

• Larisa Komsky's office was approximately a 5 or 6 minute drive from her home (Google Maps reports the distance as 1.1 miles / 1.77 km)

• In addition to following Larisa Komsky from her business to her home, the attacker hid behind another vehicle while Ms. Komsky parked her car and then ambushed her when she exited the vehicle

• The neighbors reportedly heard Ms. Komsky cry out ""What are you doing here?"" (as opposed to ""What are you doing?"" per the write-up)

A neighbor also reportedly heard Ms. Komsky call her attacker ""you son of a bitch"" (which, fair criticism for someone who has just stabbed you)

It sounds like the attack on Ms. Komsky was a continuation of an earlier conflict or altercation. I wonder if her attacker was escalating a random argument with a stranger-- or if the attacker was an acquaintance or somehow related to/involved with a client of her CPA [Certified Public Accountant] firm. I imagine that law enforcement has looked at potential leads related to her professional life-- I would be curious about whether any of her clients were in high-conflict financial situations (for example: a married couple who are in the process of separation/divorce or a jointly-owned LLC with some accounting anomalies that could point to fraud or embezzlement)

"Robin and Kenyatta were both so very young. They both deserved bright futures and full lives. 

I hope that both James Derrick Grubbs and Donnie Ray Tempel remain in prison. I think that in 2018 one of them was up for parole or resentencing. 

Robin's mother may have been in shock. However, she kept telling people that Robin was alive. Even when Robin's remains were located she said that it could not be Robin because she just saw Robin. According to Robin's brother, this likely hindered Robin's case.

I hope that law enforcement takes another look at Robin's case. There could be physical evidence linking Grubbs and Tempel to Robin's remains.",0

"Thank you for this write-up! I grew up in the area and this case has stuck with me for a decade or so, ever since I first heard of it. I’ve asked my mom about it and she was too young/uninterested as a youth to have remembered if there was any news about it at the time. If I had to guess, I’d guess animals scattering bones, since there are so few. Who knows if they got the bones from the cemetery, an old-time burial plot… or like, from someone’s private property where they buried a victim.

"Whales are such fascinating creatures, wrote papers on them back in uni. Their ability to communicate was so interesting to me, and the level of complexity in their sounds is much higher than you’d first think. Look up “bowhead whale songs” they’re so cool. Hopefully this whale is left alone and allowed to live its life in peace.

The idea of it being deaf is most compelling to me. It being a unique species seems unlikely to me, since it’s the only whale doing this and I find it unlikely that this whale is the only individual left and also a species that hasn’t run into humans. Whales have very long lifespans too, so it would be pretty unlikely for us to never find another individual with this call if there was a whole other species. Its unusual swimming patterns could be because it struggles or cannot locate other whales. His urge to migrate based on seasons will be in its DNA but an inability to coordinate or communicate with other whales means he could just be off on his own and winging it.",0

"Most of what you’ve probably read about [Elizabeth Short](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Dahlia) AKA The Black Dahlia has probably been a lie. She wasn’t a prostitute or a lesbian, she may not have even been an actress (though some say she did have actress aspirations, it doesn’t look like she pursued them).  She is the most sensationalized murder victim in the history of true crime. In truth, she was a young woman who lived a difficult, complicated life and died during the peak of salacious, sensationalized media. 

The way we’ve mythologized this case has led to the water being muddied with countless [suspects](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Dahlia) that all seem to be no more likely than the next. I don’t think we’ve ever come close to find Elizabeth’s killer because I don’t think anybody ever looked at him",0

"I'm a big Manics fan and I can't see it being anything but suicide. Richey was very ill, and speaking as someone who has faced the same mental health struggles that he had, suicide becomes the only way out in your mind after enough time. 

The main rebuttal to the suicide theory is the one time in an interview where Richey said he'd never even thought about committing suicide because he 'can handle pain'. I remember being intensely suicidal for 2 years, then being totally adamant I'd never commit suicide for another 2 years, before becoming suicidal again during the pandemic. All it takes to flip that switch is major stress. Richey had just got out of psychiatric inpatient treatment in 1994, and after hospitalisation, it's said he was never quite the same again.

When asked whether Richey was hospitalised as a result of a suicide attempt, his bandmate and close friend Nicky Wire said “I couldn’t tell you what happened. I just saw the results. It was pretty frightening to look at. Everybody was scared. I mean, there’s a difference between carving ‘4 Real’ into his arm and the point he’s got to now”.

Hearing that, it's open and shut for me. I only hope Richey found peace. He was such a beautiful, gentle soul and an amazing poet. He deserved better.",0
"That really is sad, and she was so caring. Spent her last moments on earth trying to feed homeless cats. And since she was a widow with no children, there is probably nobody to report on what her last week looked like.

I think there’s also been a few genetic genealogy cases where they’ve found who the perpetrator was before they found who the victim was.

There’s also several victims of different serial killers that it’s established they’ve killed a specific victim but we have no idea who they are (Robert Hansen, Dean Corll, Larry Eyler, LISK.)",0

"Because it's completely harmless one way or another, I love the [moose in New Zealand mystery](https://www.herrickcreek.co.nz/pages/history). See, NZ doesn't have any native land mammals other than some bats. Save for our weird-ass birds that don't know how to be birds, some insects, arachnids and a few reptiles, everything's been imported (even humans!). And early 20th century hunters wanted something big to hunt after getting tired of pigs and deer. So they tried bringing over moose in 1900. It didn't work out.

So they tried again in 1910. (No, the moose didn't even last 10 years. Oops?)

The mystery isn't whether or not there've been moose in NZ -- we know there were. The mystery is whether any of the moose descendants are still alive. You may be thinking ""But how can you not know if there are any moose? NZ is small!"" Well, the moose were set loose in the dense bush of ~~the West Coast~~ Fiordland (sorry, wrong empty part of the country!), which is not very easy terrain for humans to navigate and you can't really see much from the air. (Also, nobody lives there to begin with.)

The last confirmed moose sighting via photograph was in 1952, but there have been reported sightings and alleged DNA evidence in the 2000s.

My personal theory is that they're living in the underground caves during the day and come up at night to feed. I know nocturnal cave-dwelling moose make no fucking sense, but when you look at NZ's other animals and how they've evolved, it seems just as likely. (Am I joking? Perhaps. But hey, why not?)

I guess you could say... it's an unresolved moose-tery.

EDIT: Found [a better article](https://www.themeateater.com/conservation/wildlife-management/the-phantom-moose-of-fiordland) that explains more about the history and the geography of the supposed moose-inhabited region.

EDIT2: Wasn't expecting this many upvotes! To be completely serious I know the chances there are still moose roaming about are extremely low, but that answer's *boring*. It's amusing to me that there might be some moose out there in NZ and nobody knows!",0

You always made me laugh even through the hard crap in life and I wish you were here now. My kids adored you and are broken inside at your loss.  You would have loved your great Niece - she is beautiful. I know you lived hard, loved harder and sometimes made really stupid choices that had very high ramifications and we had to agree to disagree on a lot of things but one thing we both knew beyond no doubt is that we loved each other.  I promise to take care of our mom and dad and am hoping that you will be there to greet them when they get there too.

""[Yellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_yellow)"" and ""mulatto"" were indeed mostly synonymous for what might be called ""biracial"" today -- They might also have some social class connotations, with lighter skin tone & and mixed race implying somewhat better education and employment prospects than darker would.",0

Apparently the family tried to get the IOPC to investigate the way the case was handled, but they refused and made the North Wales police do their own investigation into themselves. They found that they did make mistakes, including not getting hold of CCTV and letting it expire, but still stand by their theory that he committed suicide. Their reason for not finding the body is that they think he dove into the sea.

""They (the police) believe that the man that Tony was meeting was an associate of his, and that he'd withdrawn money. ""It's painting a picture. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to work out that they are trying to portray him as purchasing drugs.""

You've got to wonder if he was depressed and doing drugs, and decided to end it all. Or if it's just the cops trying to cover their ass due to screwing up the investigation. To just claim he jumped into the ocean without showing evidence seems like a really grim thing for the cops to publicly say though, and I really feel for the family.",0
"It looks like she was an only child, too.  How awful for her parents.  

I'm curious how Arnold's confession came about - whether he spontaneously offered up (ultimately inaccurate) details of a crime (for example, 'once I strangled a girl in a car in Kentucky') and investigators in Oregon then looked for a case that matched up, or whether there was some connection to the area that led investigators to ask him about Betty and he just told them what they wanted to hear.  Either way, I tend to agree that his confession was likely false.

 If there were fingerprints taken from the car that have never been matched, that would suggest that whoever left them has avoided being on law enforcement's radar for all the time since, or for the remainder of their life, if they've died in the time since.",0

If it was just that she + her car had disappeared, I would have wondered if she hadn't accidentally ended up in a body of water, but the business with her bank account would tend to rule that out.  

Her Charley Project page goes into a bit more detail on the men connected to both Joanne's ex and the woman who had her bank book.  One of them was suspected of multiple murders of police informants or people otherwise connected to the local drug trade.  Her ex was apparently also involved in that scene, and Joanne may have taken part and been introduced to the other players during their relationship.  

If she had distanced herself from that scene after a breakup, it doesn't seem like a great leap to imagine these guys deciding that she might be talking to the police and killing her as they had others.  There could also have been a financial motive, if they knew through the grapevine that she'd recently come into some cash.  

Frank Cerimele disappeared five years earlier, while Joanne would still have been a teenager.  I wonder how long she had been involved with the ex; maybe the implication is that she knew (or someone thought she knew) something about not just his/his acquaintances drug sales but also their involvement in more serious crimes?",0

His crimes were horrific; he sexually abused, tortured, and murdered dozens of indigenous Chanka people in their remote village over a period of years, while carefully manipulating local authorities and the justice system in order to avoid punishment for his crimes. There's not a lot of information about him online but he's another example of one of history's earliest serial killers, and one of the worst as well.",0

"I think that Nicole did not have any security (financial / housing). She was living with the street preacher, Lemasani Briggs. The street preacher and Nicole were not in a stable roommate relationship. It is described as getting bad. From this living situation / mutual friends, Nicole likely met Helena and Devin Martin and Siolo Hearne (Helena's sister). 

Nicole probably commuted two hours to Best Buy because that is where she could find work. Also, I think that Nicole was living place to place. I don't get the impression that she was settled into one place. 

It is said that she was looking for a place to live (for her, Arianna, and teenage child), and, found one. She told people that she had purchased baby furniture for Arianna. When Nicole went missing she had another roommate. This roommate said that Nicole had been talking about bringing Arianna home for 3-4 weeks. 

I think that Nicole told this babysitting group that she wanted Arianna back. The babysitters told Nicole that she could not have Arianna back because Nicole was planning to move her (Arianna) too far away. 

The last I read, The Martins and Hearne living in Vegas. I do not think that any of them have given accounts of where Arianna is, or the last time they say that they saw her. Nicole's family seems to believe that they took Arianna because they wanted her (and murdered Nicole to get Arianna). 

I don't think that there have been any arrest because law enforcement cannot prove who the last person was to see Arianna alive. Or, who / where Arianna was when Nicole was murdered. 

Hopefully Arianna is found safe and sound.

I'd be worried given the time period and the fact she went missing overnight before the police may have written her off and failed to investigate thoroughly.

It would be interesting for a cold case investigator to revisit the crime scene photos and re-interview her friends to get a better picture of the person or persons Deborah may have been involved with.",0
"I hate to say it but having the car abandoned along the PCH leads me sadly to one conclusion ——that she took her own life, most likely spontaneously. If she was still battling the panic attack she might very well have gone onto the beach in Malibu, entered the water, and expired. The surf can be pretty dangerous if you aren’t prepared for it. Since the majority of suicides are spontaneous and often decided in the ten minutes before the act, she may have parked, fled the car and been consumed by the waves when she entered the water, especially since she was fully dressed (presumably as there’s no mention of her clothing on the beach) and clothing and shoes quickly weigh you down. My last thought is that just because the video doesn’t show Elaine in distress doesn’t mean she wasn’t battling panic when she left Divine’s home.

OP I hope you have conquered your own panic attacks.  Thank you for sharing Elaine’s story.",0

A woman in the UK was recently going through trial for killing babies in her ward.  I personally think there should be a very trackable way of proving who did this to these babies, and I'm surprised they didn't investigate better.

It really scares me that a lot of times it comes down to who can make the better point, not who is right. Especially in crime scenarios.

Additionally, I wonder if they tried schools in the area, gold braces are not typical and someone would have noticed them in school. I dont even think they do golden braces in a usual practice and orthodontics, its very unusual for someone to have them.

"My parents were born in northern BC -- granted, they lived there decades before the Jack family, but unless things had changed a lot, it would have been unusual for child care to be provided at a remote job site. In my folks' time, there might be a lumber mill or a fish cannery, with workers' families living in small cabins (more recently, resource operations don't have the families there, hence the term ""man camps"").   
But unless the arrangement was in the informal sense -- maybe that there were already families up there, and one of the at-home parents had agreed to keep an eye on some extra kids -- the idea of having an actual day care centre up there is a bit unusual.  


That's the only thing that makes me wonder about why the guy would go to such lengths to get the entire family to come up -- instead of suggesting that the parents ask relatives to babysit them while they were away working. It's odd that he wouldn't just move on and ask somebody else. If his operation were that desperate for employees ... I suspect that this wouldn't have been the first time they were doing last-ditch recruitment, and that someone else in that town or nearby would have remembered a similar situation.",0

ETA: Looking the deaf school in 1940, there's a young man with surname Lewis, who's the right age and race. His draft card shows him living in Chicago 1944. I don't immediately see any records for him after that. Ancestry's recommendations have him mixed with a white man of the same name.

And there were certainly tons of places to spend time on an ocean liner that weren't your stateroom. (Ladies' lounges, library, etc.)

"I think this is one of those cases that people immediately classify as 'weird' and go into reading about it thinking something is off. If you're already suspicious, I think it's easy to grasp onto odd details and lose sight of the bigger picture.

Personally I think there are a lot of strange facts in this case, but it was a very strange situation *before* Rebecca's death. Her boyfriend's son had been horribly injured in a bizarre accident, Rebecca's sister was visiting and present when the accident happened and then quickly bundled off back home, boyfriend's brother starts staying at the house because of the inured nephew, entire family is understandably massively upset and confused, then she gets word that Max is going to be taken off life support. That's a lot to have happen in a short time frame, and I'm sure Rebecca was also aware that her relationship with her boyfriend probably wouldn't survive his son's death on her watch. 

Yes, it's an odd suicide and we can each come up with some portion of it that 'I would *never*' or 'women don't...' but there are a few details about Rebecca's life that indicate she reacted dramatically to things (I don't quite know how to word that, I'm absolutely not trying to be disrespectful towards her), namely pretending to be kidnapped when one of her prior relationships was ending. A lot of the details people cite as proof it was murder come directly from the Zahau family attorney during the civil lawsuit against the boyfriend's brother, not from facts established in court.

To me it comes down to the fact that there was enough going on in Rebecca's life to seriously unravel even the most stable person, there's no actual evidence of anyone else's involvement, and if it's a weird suicide it's a far stranger fake suicide to cover up a murder.",0

Having said that, the investigation into the Yorkshire Ripper was seriously derailed by hoax letters and a tape that supposedly contained details only the killer would know. It was later shown all the information could be found in newspaper reports. 

That would require research into the press reports at the time and comparing them to the information in the letters. If it could be shown that nothing in the letters wasn't already reported then this theory might have some merit.

The only exception to this would be someone who had access to the police reports. Not as unlikely as it seems. I read a book about the Monster of Florence.

I don't know the area or anyone involved, but this screams suicide to me. People who are suicidal often appear to be 'getting better' because they've finally found a way out of their depression. I'd like to know if 'seemed to be doing better' was an observation by a doctor, or just someone he knew saying ""well he seems happier these days"".

"Similar circumstances to the time my cousin found skeletal remains in the desert during a geology field trip in Northern Mexico. The skull was located first having been washed down from a nearby gully - additional remains were located there.

It was good for his village to have closure, as in this case.

"I work in the logistics field and am fairly familiar with 53' trailers (I used to inspect them) and trucker culture. 

I'm curious as to whether the trailer had swing doors or a roll door? Swing doors are pretty quiet to open but you have to open them before pulling a vehicle up to the trailer to load... Roll doors are a lot louder to open but you can pull up flush to the back of the trailer before opening the doors, which makes it easier to unload quickly.

I don't know about the frequency of weigh stations along the interstate in California, but in the Midwest they would have encountered a couple of them within 300 miles, which would make having left at midnight absolutely impossible. I'm a little surprised that a Brinks truck wouldn't have GPS built into the trailer or a camera, since a lot of trailers that haul lower value goods have one or both of those.

From my experience and from anecdote, most seasoned long haul truckers could sleep through a tornado. This is out of necessity since truck stops and the road itself can be pretty noisy and chaotic. A driver not waking up while the trailer was unloaded is not surprising at all... Trucks tend to park close enough to each other that it could just be another driver checking their load.

Also curious as to what time the convention wound down, since most I'm familiar with seem to close closer to 5 or so and both drivers would have been required to load the trailer. I'm wondering if they gave an earlier time for when the second driver went to sleep because they were trying to do math on the spot to cover for the fact that the second driver might have been getting ready to take over on less than 10 hours of rest?

"If you study up on the Tylenol Murders, you will see that the big problem with Lewis as a suspect is that all evidence suggests he was in New York City at the time the contaminated bottles were placed on the drugstore shelves in Chicago.  He would have needed to be in the Chicago area during a specific day and have a car available to make those deliveries when they occurred.  He didn’t own a car at the time and no evidence could be found that he rented a car in either Chicago or New York.  While there might be senecios available that might explain away these issues, they are not probable.  It is quite common for people to attempt to extort from the families of kidnapping victims when they had nothing to do with the actual kidnapping.  That is most likely what happened in this case.  

Some DNA was found on some of the pills in one of the bottles.  It is likely, but not certain, that it belonged to the poisoner.  If that DNA was linked to anyone without an “innocent” reason to have handled those pills it would be highly incriminating.  That DNA has not been linked to Lewis. The lasting interest in Lewis had less to do with any real evidence of his guilt and more to do with the fact that he was pretty much the only suspect.",0
"First of all, I don't think Terri did it. She had no time to do so. If she left Skyline at 8:45 (more likely at 8:50, since went up the stairs when the bell rang, said goodbye to Kyron and walked out of the school to the truck), her next hour would be like this:

* 8:50 ca - driving from school
* 9:00 ca (ten minute driving time) - arrives at Fred Meyer at Imbrie Drive, looking for medicine for her daughter but not finding it.
* 9:12 - gets a receipt for coffee at the Starbucks at that same Fred Meyer
* 9:30 ca (10 minute driving time) - arrives at Fred Meyer at Walker Rd, goes into the store, finds medicine, chats with an acquaintance, then drops of a couple of shirts at a dry cleaners
* 10:00 ca - leaves the Fred Meyer, drives to a Michaels craft store (ca 5 minutes away)
* 10:10-10:15 ca - leaves Michaels, gives her daughter the medicine, sits for about half an hour trying to get her to sleep before driving up to highway 30 to let the motion of the car soothe her. 

The last point is the time where Terri can't be verified on CCTV or by witnesses. A phone ping does place her at highway 30, but that's it. However, at 10:00 the school had noted Kyron's absence. So Terri would not be able to get Kyron from the school at any point before he was confirmed as missing. There's also the fact that no one saw Kyron leave with her, and that no one saw Kyron in the truck at any of the Fred Meyers (he wasn't with her in the stores).

No, what I think happened is this. At 8:45 the students were supposed to gather in groups of five or six to tour the exhibits, and it seems to have been a fairly chaotic affair. A classmate saw Kyron in the upstairs hallway shortly after Terri left, and Kyron said he was going to see an electrical exhibit (which a parent said was in another upstairs classroom, in a blog comment). A friend of Kyron's brother then saw Kyron in the gym, with some of his friends, looking at other exhibits. And finally he arrived at downstairs classroom 109. There is a blog that published witness statements from some of the children that they saw Kyron leave that room and go outside with a man who asked for help to bring something from his truck. Right outside 109 was the access road that led to the Skyline boulevard, and where someone saw Kyron with an unknown person by a white truck. The truck was commonly called Terri's truck in the media, but at that point witnesses had been primed to see any white truck they remembered as Terri's.

So, a man, probably not a local, walked into the open to the public school. He roamed the halls, acting like he belonged there (there were children who commented on facebook that there had been a creeper there, so not everyone was fooled), until he found a child that seemed pliable and meek. He lured him out of the school via the access road, took him to his truck parked at the access road (where a chain blocked it from going further in), got Kyron inside the car and drove far, far away. He couldn't know the school would mess up and not notice or report Kyron's absence until much later, but it really wouldn't matter, as he would be in Portland before the cops arrived even if the school reacted immediately.",0
"It's believed to be related to the Beaumont children case a few years prior, so there's a TON of overlap between their potential suspects. 

The description given lines up well with Arthur Stanley Brown, who told an acquaintance he was in the area at the time. He was even identified by a witness years later, when he was on trial for murdering two other young girls. However, there isn't any evidence he was ever in South Australia, though it is believed that work records placing him there were destroyed in a flood in the 70s. On top of that, Brown was a government worker who could've had access to these files, and destroyed them himself.

"I guess that the most statistically likely outcome is that the husband did it, given their seemingly difficult relationship (at the time) and him getting into a new relationship so quickly. Still, if he did it, then killing his wife and youngest child would be odd. From what I understand, all of the kids are theirs (in a lot of these cases the partner kills the child that is from a previous relationship), so why would he kill the youngest? 

In cases like these I always wonder, did the person who just ""got up and left"" never said anything, absolutely anything? She had two other kids who could tell if mom mentioned going somewhere. 

Another posibility is some kind of a double suicide caused by post-partum depression or other mental issues. I know that the family said that she was doing well, but you never know what another person is thinking. Foul play is also possible, but there's not enough information to tell for me.

"This is a case that is very obscure outside of Spain and, at first glance looks very mysterious, but when you take into account the circumstances surrounding the people involved you realize that it's way, way simpler than mystery boards and publications make it look like. So much so, than a PI working for the family has tried to tell them over and over that there's no elaborate scheme. **The 1988 disappearance of the Orrit-Pirés children.**

I've spoken about this case a few times in this subreddit, [here's one of the most recent comments I've made about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/xw4kfg/comment/ir5g725/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) with a (I hope) detailed enough explanation of the case -includes pictures and more info. But in case you don't feel like going to another thread here's a summary;

The night between 4th to 5th September of 1988 in a hospital in Manresa, Catalonia; a 5-year old boy (**Isidro Orrit-Pirés**), who was admitted to the hospital and set to undergo a tonsillectomy in the morning, disappears along his 17-year old sister **(Dolores Orrit-Pirés),** who was staying with him overnight\*\*.\*\* Basically, when the nurses came to Isidro's room at 6AM to wheel him to the surgery room both children were gone, apparently without any trace except for a pair of glases (Dolores was very near sighted, but the glasses were eventually linked to another person). Sniffer dogs traced their scent all the way to the hospital gate, where they ended -which investigators interpreted as the kids getting into a car there.

Over the years there have been lots of speculating narratives regarding human/organ trafficking, serial killers and what not. More recently, a guy called a TV show claiming that he had seen the kids being taken to the hospital basement where, according to him, they were sedated and wheeled in stretchers to some secret room. Interestingly, when he was invited to make a formal statement to authorities, he declined.

Now, here's the most plausible scenario; **they just left**. And this is what the PI claims having found. Their home life was absolutely shitty; **14 siblings, living in welfare at a crappy state-sponsored flat, their parents (father had died from cancer that year) were getting the kids out of school at 13 to put them to work, and wanted to have more children even though they couldn't provide for them properly.** They were half-Portuguese, and their Portuguese aunt was at the time super concerned about the children wellbeing, so much so that she had proposed she'd adopt some of them to ease the economic burden -the mother refused, she was in bad terms with her. Dolores was seen making a call from a payphone the days prior to the disappearance; it's believed she was arranging the escape.

The PI has tried to tell the family over and over that he'd found evidence of them being alive and well outside of Spain (being now adults, they have a right to privacy).

"I don’t doubt Charles may have practiced some “witchy” or “weird” peculiar, superstitious country “magick” (magic and spiritualism were very much of the zeitgeist), and though there were doubtless pagan remnants of rituals and beliefs in his village, this was actually modern times, where most people belonged to the CoE and had for ages, could read, and newspapers and trains existed (I have a letter from one of my ancestors from the 1830s in Ormskirk that contains slang and references to memes of the time and the most banal stuff you can imagine; even in boring villages people weren’t all necessarily bumpkins).

My mum’s maternal grandparents (she was born in 1942), were poor and one-generation-removed from being tenant farmers of the Earl of Derby (I still have some of the earl’s fancy horse brasses my great-great-grandfather nicked, and good on him!) and, had they lived in an isolated village rather than in a village on the outskirts of Liverpool, would have been ripe for believing any old shit that was gossiped about in the village, especially if it were a particularly isolated one. Still, in most places that era had passed, even though there were still many people in the country living, like Charles, a quite desperate, hand-to-mouth existence even into the twentieth century (my great grandfather’s great treat was having drippings on toast, and he only rode in a car twice in his life, for example…)

"I just read another article where a couple different private investigators who initially helped with the search were interviewed. Lots of red flags from the beginning. One PI said that the mom gave them the wrong year of birth, so all the fliers had to be redone. According to the PI, Rudy was actually 18 when he went missing, not 17. The picture the mom gave for the missing fliers was of Rudy when he was 14. Mom said that people would have more empathy if he looked younger. I'm guessing that the mom didn't want any current pics on the fliers because he wasn't actually missing. If anyone saw him outside the house, they wouldn't recognize him as the missing boy because he was 4 years older than what he looked like in the fliers. 

The mom told the PI that Rudy was being held by a trafficker in Mexico. The PI tracked this supposed trafficker down and the woman said that Janie (mom) had called her (apparently trying to get her to go along with the kidnap story), and she told Janie that she didn't want anything to do with her scam. 

Another PI said that Janie had them following fake trafficking leads in various places in the U.S. and Mexico.

There is so much craziness going on here. The mom apparently had dozens of fake FB pages. Some of the fake pages had fake relationships and these fake profiles would comment back and forth with each other. Over the years, the mom (on various fake profiles) would post pics like most people do of meals at restaurants, her arm in a cast and other injuries, appreciation posts for her friends, etc. Reverse image search found that most of these pics were just stolen from elsewhere on the internet, including the pics of her ""friends"" and/or ""boyfriends"".

If what Rudy said is true, I can't believe he was allowed to just leave with his mom. I know he's an adult, but if this abuse has been going on for 8 years, then I hope LE is just getting their ducks in a row before charging mom with something. 

But there is a woman in the Rudy FB group who said that both the mom and Rudy previously worked security at an illegal game room. This woman and her husband either worked there or managed, I can't remember. The mom worked day shift and Rudy worked evening/night. Rudy went by the name ""Gabe"". She said Rudy would always do cocaine in the bathroom which is what led to him being fired. She said the mom was fired for refusing to wear a mask during covid. LOL!!

The areas these women went missing from were close to the ""strolls"". I've always thought if Tamra was taken by an outsider, it was possibly by someone driving through the area in search of a vulnerable woman. After seeing Tamra, maybe he decided to take her instead.

"The Head Of Ennius. 

VERY TLDR: the tomb of Roman general Scipio Africanus was lost for 1700~ years, when it was found and excavated in the 1930’s someone broke into a secret chamber and stole the head of a statue using professional tools. 

So… what’s the mystery? 

Again very TLDR: 

- the secret chamber was unknown to literally everyone, there’s no evidence it existed before someone broke into it using professional tools 

- in the 70’s Italian author Ranuccuio Bandinelli writes a book about Italian antiquity but dies before he finishes it, his close friend and student finishes the book for him but finds a hidden trunk with hand-sketched diagrams from the 1910’s of a very similar tomb with a marked out area that resembles the secret rooms interior almost exactly with no ‘source’ material for these sketches. 

- the 80’s roll around and the re-edition of this book completely remove all mentions of the hand drawn diagrams in favour of a most likely made up story about dock workers. Only copies printed in 1976-1981 feature the original notes. 

- in the 90’s an archaeology professor at the university of Florence writes an article about the excavation and claims that at one point he had valued the head at €1200 but never heard from the stranger who brought it to him again

- in 2020 Mario Torelli (the co-author and student of the original author) dies

- in 2020 after Mario’s death someone on the Sapienza university forum claims that there was a “marble head” encased in Mario’s home when he visited there in 2019. 

- in March of 2021 one of Mario’s children says that they remember a “statue head” being on display in their fathers office but didn’t know what it was or where it went after his death

To this day the head is still missing, but more importantly how did someone have hand drawn notes of an almost 2000 year old sealed room.",0

"Not sure if your question is rhetorical (and disclaimer obviously killing a child is never OK or excusable) but by way of explanation for why this happens, a few possible reasons why: 

-the baby is the result of rape or incest and to cope the mother is in denial or dissociated from their bodies to the extent they cant accept or even recognize they are pregnant until they give birth. They have none of the typical attachment responses and they want to just “get away” from the reminder of the trauma or they mentally shut down, neglect or smother the baby as a trauma reaction. In that context taking the baby to a safe haven or doing literally anything else would be acknowledging the truth of what happened to them which is too overwhelming and unbearable, they just need it to be over and to distance as much as possible from what happened. 

-the mother is in an abusive situation and the baby is killed by the partner and she’s afraid to go to the police for fear of retaliation, or they’re killed by the mother in course of abuse (eg crying is escalating partner and she smothers them, hurt by partner or drop while breastfeeding -a lot of abusive ppl get controlling around feeding baby-, partner won’t let her leave to get medical care, etc.)

-drugs or serious mental illness is involved, or they are a teen in a highly restrictive/religious household and they panic and don’t know what to do. For example they go to school to try to pretend it didn’t happen and because they’re afraid of their parents reaction they don’t get help caring for baby, or go get high to try to deal with the overwhelming feelings of what just happened (usually substance use also coincides with abuse), and baby dies of exposure or neglect. 

Or if delusional may think they’re “protecting” baby from Satan/evil in the world (while sometimes severely mentally ill people are overall not functioning other times the delusion is more targeted and they’re able to compartmentalize/go about regular life.) 

Again none of these responses are OK or logical, and the majority of trauma survivors/teens/ppl with substance use disorders don’t kill their children. Sometimes people are just messed up and kill their kids out of spite, convenience, etc.

"It’s so easy to assume that something bad has happened because it’s incomprehensible to family and friends that someone chooses to leave. 

I was blindsided recently by Robert Hoagland. He had a apparent blissful family life, nice house, three kids, wife, almost at retirement. There was a big thing about how he would never leave his family. His wife, kids and best friend said that adamantly. People thought he had gone to confront a drug dealer because his son had become involved and was going off the rails and had possible been killed. 

Turns out he choose to leave, went to a house share with another male in another part of US (not far away but I’m not from US so I don’t know how far you class as far!). He lived a quiet life, didn’t share his past, volunteered as a cook in shelters and churches and was even pictured in a local news article. He died and it was only proven then who he was.  

That one case really made me open my eyes!",0
"I love this mystery. Alvarez/Naschy (his onscreen name) was a passionate fan of the classic Universal horror films, and something like the Lon Chaney of Spanish horror films. He briefly worked (as a extra) with Boris Karloff on an American television show, and considered it one of the highlights of his life.

The only source for the existence of this film is Naschy himself. Possibilities that have been tossed around horror fandom include:

* Naschy simply misremembered, and mistook this (non-existent) film for ***The Fury of the Wolfman,*** which was made in 1970 and can be viewed today. It's also possible that ***Nights of the Werewolf*** was scripted, but not filmed, and elements were adapted for the 1970 film. Naschy scripted the latter, and may have written a script for this one. 
* Naschy imaginatively made up the credit for his career, at a time when he only had one horror film on his resume, and wanted to kick start his dream of becoming a horror film star (he did eventually succeed).
* The film was really made. However, there's no evidence for this. No director by the name Rene Govar ever worked in the Spanish film industry (or any other nation's film industry, for that matter). No one else in the Spanish film industry ever confirmed that they worked on the movie.

Film journalists have researched this movie, for any evidence (other than Naschy's recounting) that it was ever made, and have not been able to find anything. Not a frame, not a set photo, not a paper record, not a trade advertisement.",0

"I think it's probably too late to put the cork back on it at this point. But I think conclusions might be being jumped to here.

As far as I can tell, an anonymous person posted in RBI2 looking for their sister named Jeanetta Brooks, and people in the comments ran with the possibility of St Louis Jane Doe matching the circumstances of the missing person. I don't know if it's been confirmed that Jeanetta is indeed a missing person, or if the poster is legitimate at all. 

The connection between the demographics and circumstances of the RBI2 post were made by Redditors and sent to police who are now trying to make a connection. But the problem is, now we have a situation of broken telephone where some commenters are claiming they got in touch with the poster and it's a ""false story"" but are also not elaborating. So it's a lot of speculation, a lot of people claiming things and not a lot of confirmed facts just yet. I think the first step will be to confirm the existence of Jeanetta and to establish if she is indeed a missing person. Even if she is not connected to our Doe, if there is a missing person in this case she deserves to be given an investigation. 

I guess we just have to wait and see.",0

Everyone knows he did something to her. Sorry, but I don't know anyone who doesn't think it was him. 

A couple years back I randomly dreamt of her. She was trying to tell me something but (sorry, this is awful) her mouth was sewn shut. I shared it with friends I grew up with.

"She is listed in the 1900 census as born in 1770 in Pennsylvania. Living in the same group home. Race black, marital status single, occupation chambermaid. Months not employed 0 (so apparently still working as of 1900!) and can read and write. The census taker wrote her age (130) in extra-bold letters and drew a circle around it.

She apparently died on 7 Jan 1906. Ancestry.com lists an obituary for her that was published on 11 Jan 1906 in the Beatrice Weekly Times (Beatrice, Nebraska). According to the information transcribed in Ancestry’s record (I can’t view the original because I don’t have a Newspapers.com subscription) she was born on 14 Nov 1770 in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania.

Edit: her [death certificate](https://www.ancestry.com/discoveryui-content/view/2234290:5164?tid=&pid=&queryId=acceabae2b3cc31b05afa08bfdfab74e&_phsrc=QoS2&_phstart=successSource) gives the same date of birth as the obituary above, but date of death as 5 Jan. She’s listed as widowed, parents unknown. Cause of death is “shock from an accidental fall” with old age as a contributing factor. [Here](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/144816802/mary-macdonald?_gl=1*1dovpz1*_gcl_au*ODY5MDYzMzY1LjE2ODM2NDI1NTU.*_ga*MTU1NzgyNDg5MC4xNjc0MjYwMTEx*_ga_4QT8FMEX30*Y2RlOTRmNTYtMzc1ZC00NDM5LTlhZmMtMjk2ZWY0MjNmYWQzLjI3LjEuMTY4Nzc3NDk4My41MS4wLjA.) is her FindAGrave memorial page with a photo. It has a couple of articles published around 1896-1897 (age listed as 126) that provide the same birthdate, but one suggests that she was born in Virginia rather than Pennsylvania. Another 1893 article states that she was born in Virginia—according to *that* article she was born in 1765. That’s the earliest documentation of her claims that I can find so far, and it’s inconsistent with her claims from a few years later.

2nd edit: I just noticed that there’s a transcription error in Mary McDonald’s 1900 census entry on Ancestry. It looks like she is followed by three much younger women who were chambermaids in the home, and the information about occupation and literacy was mistakenly copied from the next row. It looks like Mary had no occupation and could not read or write.",0

The fact that his personal possessions were still on him doesn’t say too much.

This is one of those situations where based on everything I’ve read I think he probably did do it but there wasn’t enough evidence and rather than build their case properly the state violated Brady and lied. At that point it would be incredibly wrong to continue to hold him in prison. I imagine he wins at the new trial. This is what happens when the state takes shortcuts or forces something that isn’t there. People should direct their anger towards the state that screwed up the case and what circumstantial evidence they did have. If he is truly innocent then it makes it sting even more but even if he is guilty the court proceedings HAVE to go right. If we arrive at the correct conclusion ILLEGALLY then it taints the veracity of the conclusion.,0

I presume the bottom is open. Or did they give you chopsticks to fish it out of the bottle?,0
I'd like to imagine they put a rock in the dishwasher.,0
The shovel is dumb but I like the branded bun.,0
It's fancy when in a wine or Martini glass,0
someone please tell me i'm not the only one who has no clue what is happening in this photo,0
Awesome. Just needs some pollen and some spiderwebs and we could have a “shitty spring cuisine” theme.,0
"No plate, we dump the pasta straight into the bag.",0
I imagine the fries will be soggy and limp if you don't dump it all out right away.,0
Wheeeeeee…….check please.,0
I've had a similar experience with a similar food. Uli's sausages in Pike Place market in Seattle. Their brat sampler with sauerkraut and potato salad came on a wooden cutting board. And I'd eat those anyway they came.,0
Put them in a bowl. But flights of pasta sound amazing.,0
It's cool that the bacon gently caresses your brow as you sip.,0
The egg whites weren't even done cooking. Gross.,0

What did you order? It looks delicious. Was the stool on the table too high when sitting? It looks a bit odd,0
I'm not against cutting boards (and get annoyed at all the ones posted here) but this one is way too saucy to not be on something with a rim. Also it's a weirdly narrow cutting board which just exacerbates the problem.,0
"I dunno, I kinda like it",0
Thankfully there are bowls for the ice cream but I still don’t get the presentation and why it’s on a plank. And wth is the stuff that looks like a stick of chalk broken up!?,0

"Disclaimer:  This is only the one restaurant, and I don't know how everywhere does it.

I know a guy who works in high fine dining.  They use bamboo clothespins to hang these fancy kebabs from a wire rack, and serve stuff on wooden boards and stone slates.  They dispose of the clothespins after one use, because they're like eight cents each.  They also don't use any that are broken, chipped, or discolored.  The wire rack and little dipping bowls go through the dishwasher as normal, and the stone and wooden slates are hand washed with a disinfectant solution that's supposed to get in all the nooks and crannies.  He describes dish washing there as ""miserable"".",0

you think they ever wash those clothes pins? I'd be grossed out by that,0
What's the thing that looks like an alien egg.,0
"I actually like this. Air flow on the bottom would help ensure that the crust retains crispness, and the fact that it is finger food precludes the necessity for cutlery which would have been hindered by the rack. The only downside that I can see is that the elevation would allow the pizza to potentially cool quicker than it would on a warm plate, but I doubt that that pizza would last that long in front of me. It looks delicious.",0
"Pretty sure that’s a traditional mortar here, used to use it to make sauces, not an ashtray…",0

To be honest the plank isn't the only odd bit there,0
I think the wood ones are the scariest tbh because they could be moldy inside…if they get washed at all. Plus the splinters…,0

Damn that looks good.,0
"Love the plating honestly, in a major gimmicky way",0
It's not even big enough to eat on. Might as well plate it on the table at this point.,0
I’m ok with this. Desserts like this are often served in little cups and this one is a clever play on the espresso in the tiramisu.,0
The prosciutto in the clothesline is to distract you from the fact that you were promised focaccia and got a slice of Texas toast instead.,0

If you’ve ever been a server in a restaurant that features nachos or enchiladas and the like… you’ve got battle scars on your forearms to prove it!

At least they’re not serving it on the shovel… the only real dumb shit about this is having them do it in the dining room for flair as opposed to just putting it on the tray in back. Good idea, dumb ass execution.",0
"seriously- this is an example of why I always check Google maps for pictures linked to a restaurant- and then sort by newest......

Crispy on the to soggy on the bottom,0
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 it's like they are mocking you,0
Nope - Hummus in Trowell maybe ( Nottingham lass),0
Gotta be honest....doesn't look great for the premium likely paid.  But hey...edible flower = charge 4x as much,0

What am I even looking at here?,0
"Plates are; things I don't eat that provide a surface on which I can set my food; to ensure that nothing I plan to eat is touching something I wouldn't be comfortable licking; shaped in a way which allows no part of the meal to escape; not impediments to my ability to comfortably consume my food.

I gave this a lot of thought, just now.

Pizza doesn't qualify, I want to eat it, unless it's not edible and then it's just a plate and not a pizza and anyway the pizza would need a plate as well, which touches on a double plate situation...",0

It's just overdone, often unhygenic, and totally impractical.",0

Yöü göt lärgë spöön,0
"Again, please tell me what you ordered.  I like to know what's being presented. Sometimes it informs the platelets why.",0
Why would  they put sand and tomatoes on a perfectly good dessert.,0
It was $9,0
Looks like something you'd make with whatever's left in the fridge after you forgot to go shopping. And you'd serve it like that if you'd also forgotten to do the dishes.,0

"Wedding rehearsals aren’t for the guests.  They’re for the bridal party to practice stuff like where to stand, when to walk in and out, stuff like that.

Then, it’s common to do a dinner that includes a subset of the guests (usually the bridal party and close family, i.e. those involved with the rehearsal).

So it’s not weird that you’ve never heard of it just by being to lots of weddings, though if you’ve been married and have been in the bridal party for a lot of people and have still never done a rehearsal, that’s pretty rare!",0

> Pull them closer and push them away, verbally and physically, to add tension. Creating a push-and-pull dynamic is one of the best ways to create sexual tension; you’ll show them you’re interested—but not too interested—then back off to keep them wanting more. You can do this both verbally and physically to create an exciting, flirty interaction.
Try verbally pushing and pulling by saying something like, “I keep thinking how sweet you look… but I’m not sure I can trust you.”
You could also play a bit of physical push-and-pull by doing something like leaning into them and talking right in their ear, then sliding away.

"When I was in high school, a guy asked me to prom. He asked over text first and said he’d do a promposal if I said yes because he didn’t want to pressure me. I said yes, had a panic attack thinking about all the people that would be there, and had to text him back and rescind my yes. 

I felt horrible about it. Like I was saying “yes lol PSYCH bitch you thought.” But he understood and told me it was absolutely fine, which was the best response I could’ve hoped for. 

And to the kids still in school who struggle with anxiety or just don’t like people: my mom pressured me to go to the homecoming and prom dances because “you’ll regret it later if you don’t.” I never went to them. I’m a grownass adult and have not regretted it once. Do what’s best for yourself.

Edit: clarification. I did not go to any of the dances and didn’t regret that decision. I realize that probably wasn’t clear in my original comment.",0

She’s so unbelievably sweet.",0

"So first, customer was definitely wrong coming at you with the rude and angry manner.  But a lot of people aren't great at managing their emotions and I can understand why he was frustrated.

You're right, everything is getting more expensive, which is why a lot of people end up going to thrift stores - they can't afford to shop at regular stores.  However, a lot of thrift stores lately have raised their prices to the point that it's literally cheaper to buy brand new stuff at your average mega-store, than buy used stuff from thrift stores.

As it comes to the pricing situation, I find it a bit weird that EVERYONE working there touches the pricing, I don't think that is very typical.  Did the owner give you some real specific training on how he expects prices to be set? Otherwise it gets left very open to interpretation by individual employees and prices vs quality could differ drastically.

It's cool that your store supports an animal shelter.  Really I think most thrift stores are run for some sort of charitable cause.  Customers get better deals and the money goes to something useful instead of some corporate bigwig's pockets.  But generally due to this charity, most thrift stores don't get re-models, because that is typically a giant waste of money just to make things look slightly cooler.  So if prices are going up to support paying a re-model, that doesn't really trend towards the charitable aspect.  Now if the place as a dump and falling apart and it HAD to be done? Ok I guess.

TLDR; customers are going to complain no matter what, but his complaint is at least halfway valid",0

"Problem is he was only given a limited amount of money and he needed the diamonds as resource for his spaceship. He also thought the woman was a human spaceship-engineer and that was the interest in diamonds, he had no idea diamonds were considered valuable on this planet, due to the artificial inflation by the diamond-families, and she wasn't who he thought she was.

Its really understandable, they kinda glance over details like this in earth-school since you're supposed to find out whats valuable in your region since earth has so many differences which makes it interesting for tourists, but nobody thinks about common carbon like that, they all use actual valuables as examples like dirutheumin.",0

"I had a lady like this once. We had bagged chips on sale at 2 for $6, normally something like $3.69 each. Lady had two bags of chip, and a candy bar. Came up to $6.99. She flipped out, that I rang the chips wrong, that they were $3 each, not $3.69. I pointed out to her on the screen where it took off the .69 on each bag, making them $3 each. Our POS showed the full price on one line, then in red, the savings subtracted on the next line. She seemed to get it, but asked,

""Well then WHY are you charging me $6.99??""

""Because you also purchased the candy,"" and I pointed to that line.

She got SO mad at me, told me she didn't like my attitude and didn't want any of it and walked out. This was about ten years ago and I still laugh. She just really wanted to blame me for the ""error"" when there was no error. It would've been so easy for her to go ""Oh yeah, that's right,"" and move on, but some people are just miserable.",0
"Had a dad return a t-shirt for his daughter, wanting to switch it for a cap, and flipped when he had to pay the difference.

See, the two items had the same price, but the t-shirt was bought on a ""two for 20% off"" type sale. But, he argued, it would be the same price because without the discount it was the same price, so he should be able to get the cap for the discounted price.

I tried to explain to him that t-shirts and caps wasn't the same.

I failed.",0
"I had that so many times when working in a bookstore. We technically were able to order out of print/used books, but we only had one supplier and had to buy at their (usually high) prices. We all know that there is a huge online market for used books, be it amazon marketplace or whatever.

We had very few costumers who were so old that they probably really didn't know how to shop online. But the majority of our costumers obviously did. I tried time and again to tell them that of course I can order it for them, but that it would come to 5 or 6 times the price that they could get online. There was almost nothing for us to earn, I guess my payment in processing those things took up the meager margin there was. So there was no profit on our side, but a loss at the customer's side when they ordered used books through us.

""So you are telling me that you DON'T WANT to order it for me? You always did it for me when you still were \[independent bookstore\](twenty years earlier).""

Right.",0

"Ah, that was a problem with the wording on the rule… the store I was a manager at some years ago had the same idea.  To customers “if it rings up wrong it’s free!”.

"I spent over 30 years in the bearing industry with three different companies.  If we didn't have what  customer needed, I would suggest the competitor.   The first company I worked for made automobile waterpump bearings.  Even after 20 plus years after I worked there, I would remember the two bearings that were not for automotive use.  When I got an inquiry for one, I would ask the appropriate questions and give them the part number and manufacturer.   I believe that I would have customers call me first because I would help them no matter what they needed and would help them.

Keep going in the direction you started.  Most customers appreciate it.",0
"Sounds like the points are added to the loyalty account when you buy stuff in-store, and are spent on gas discounts. If that’s the case, then the gas station needs more security than the store. One of your co-workers knows your phone number? If they use it in-store, they’re putting points into your account. Nobody is going to complain about their account having more points than it should.

On the other hand, if anyone who knew your phone number could **spend** your points to get **themselves** a gas discount, you’d be pissed. That’s why anyone spending points needs to know something they wouldn’t find out about you through other means (should actually require the physical card).

Might want to use this approach as an explanation. Anyone who knows your phone number can give you the points they earned on their grocery shopping trip, and it’s no big deal, but the store needs to make sure that **you** are the one getting a gas discount from your points.",0

Me - ------- Audio Video, phunkjnky speaking, can I help you?

CW - (Confused Woman) - I've been trying to get you the deliver my furniture for a week, why are you holding it hostage?  
Me:Ma'am, we are an audio video shop, we do not sell or deliver furniture 

This goes for 20 minutes. She is yelling so loud that my partially deaf office manager can hear her through the receiver, in fact the entire office can hear her.

"I am guessing that if he had 10 of A, 12 of B, and 8 of C, and they all cost the same, he expected you to count them all together and ring up 30 of A, because customers don't know or care that the computer is tracking sales and needs accurate counts, not just correct pricing. (Especially if they are old enough to remember when it wasn't computerized and cashiers did exactly that.) That's probably why he kept going on about ""those are the same price."" If he wasn't wanting you to count at all, I dunno. Maybe he was doing that thing we all do sometimes where we forget that other people do not know what is going on in our head. He knew he had a dozen of each one, so why didn't you?",0

1) Birth certificates can be *extremely difficult* to get a hold of in the USA. That may be her only copy, which she would need the information off of to get more official copies.

2) Our mail carriers are legendary for how badly they handle packages. She fully expects the outer package to be extremely damaged by the time it reaches its destination, perhaps even to the point of the outer envelope coming off. An additional addressed envelope would ensure it would at least get to either the recipient's or the sender's address eventually.

Not an excuse for her behavior, she was clearly having a time of it. But, a little insight into some behavior that would seem more normal here in the USA.",0

"Last year I was managing a deli/bakery.  One of my employees was starting to take care of a very pregnant lady at the sub bar; she was using a mart cart and I went over to see if I could help make her shopping trip a bit easier.  She tells me, “Oh no, I’m good, all I need is this sub then I can get on over to the hospital and have this baby.”

I’m sorry ma’am…what?!?

I have a good poker face so I told her to just let me of any other employee know if she needs anything.  I walked back to the bakery and my daughter (she was my decorator haha) asks me what’s wrong.  So I told her.  She was like, “Ummm…do we need to do anything here?”  I told her nope, just keep an eye out in case her labor progresses…

I went back and gave the mom-to-be a cupcake and our best wishes for a safe delivery and a healthy mom and baby.  Huge sigh of relief when she paid at SCO and left, though.  I really did NOT feel like delivering a baby that day…",0

"I managed retail for a long time and before that, I worked as a retail salesperson. 

Long story short, a customer threatened me with physical violence over a situation similar to yours. 

I was shocked when I was the one dragged back to the office by security. The customer got an apology from the store and a gift card. Security and the store manager lit into me, and they picked the wrong day. I gave it right back to them and told them I expected support, not censure for being attacked by customers. 

I was given the choice to leave, or go back on the floor. I told them I was going home, they were going to pay me for the complete shift, and I would let them know the next day if I was coming back or not. 

I came back, had an audience with the store manager and told her:

1. I will no longer allow customers to raise their voice to me. At that point, I will walk away no matter how long the line is and a manager can handle the issue.
2. Since they will not call the cops on a customer when I am a hairs-breadth away from being physically assaulted, I will physically defend myself until the threat is gone even if that means beating a customer senseless, and I will call the cops myself and press charges at that point. 
3. I expect managers to be on the floor and available.

When I became a manager, I did not allow screaming and fit pitching in my store. Raise your voice or threaten bad reviews, calls to corporate - there's the door and you can leave on your own or the police will escort you out. We don't need your kind of business. Yes, I had a few sit downs with my district managers but I always told them that's the way I'm running this store and if you don't like it, find someone else because I'm not putting up with customer abuse to me or my employees. Funny enough, I only ever had to leave one position because of it and that store is still a hot mess that can't keep managers or staff because the customers act any way they want.",0

He was a nice enough guy, and everybody needs to eat, so we tried to find a job he could do. We put him in receiving, checking in an order. Half an hour later, he was covered in price tags from head to toe. (That was the day I found out our regional manager carried blank checks in his briefcase to fire people with.)",0

"Ha ha! I used to be a closing shift manager at a grocery store. One night about 20 minutes after closing, the office assistant and I were about to leave when I saw a lady come walking around the corner, casually strolling along, shopping even though half the store lights were off. I had walked the store twice right after I locked up at midnight, but I didn't see anyone. I had even checked all the restrooms. The only place she could have been without me seeing her would likely have been in between the pallet displays on the chip and soda aisle. She was probably going through her coupons or something. Idk, but she was less than one minute away from being locked in the store alone when I noticed her. She likely would have set the motion alarm off before I could even leave the parking lot. She was not happy when I approached her and told we had already closed (it was after midnight in a town with no 24 hour grocery stores). I gave her a few minutes to finish and told her she'd have to pay with a card because all the tills were pulled and locked in the safe. She didn't like it, but what choice did she have. Who chooses to mosey around in a grocery store after 11:30 PM, knowing full well we're not an all night establishment?

That made him REALLY mad - he didn't get to pull his act. He had to suffice with snapping that it wasn't the right kind, and hurrying off.

"This reminds me of something that happened kinda recently at my job.

And my co worker was trying to tell her beforehand how much she was going to get back but the lady cut her off saying she doesn’t care about how much. Then she processes her return, only for the lady to realize it was less than what she originally paid for.

To break it down further, when you’re making a non-receipted return that you paid with either cash or a non active card, your last option is store credit. Store credit is whatever the price of the item currently is. It’s not a discounted price. You can buy the item for sale and return it later, and it can go back to full price and you can get back more than what you paid for, but on a merch card.

Anyways, the lady then goes to complain that she paid more than that, my co worker was like, “well, if you would’ve let me explain the amount it was going to be, you would’ve known beforehand.” I believe she had her get a manager after lol. I hate people sometimes.",0

"Similar to a supermarket I know in Sydney. For years, it was the only supermarket in all of Sydney, that was allowed to open on Christmas Day...every other supermarket had to close. Why was this one allowed to open? Well, the supermarket was over two levels, and the owners discovered that if they registered each level as a separate business, they could open, as the size of the shop floor for each level was within the maximum size of a business allowed to open on Christmas Day, but combined they would be over the maximum size.

I was working at customer service at an office supply store. This woman came in with a printer in a box trying to return it. She had the receipt and I politely informed her that she’d purchased it from one of our competitors. She became frustrated and proceeded to tell me we had rearranged the store. She basically described the layout of our closest competitor’s store to me. I was polite but she wasn’t having it. Eventually I found the shipping label on the printer box that had the address of the store where it came from and she finally shut up and left.,0

The answer was far more mundane. Vanilla ice cream was in a fridge in the front of the store. Other flavors were in fridges at the back of the store.

2. Do your salespeople need to put a lot of money into your company when signing up? Do they need to continue to regularly invest money into your system even if they themselves are not successfully making sales?

3. Are you putting pressure on your salespeople to bring in a certain number of new recruits per week/month/year? Would they potentially be encouraged to present a false image of what working for your company is like in order to bring in more recruits?

4. Is it easy for salespeople to leave your company with few consequences or financial damage if they decide it’s not for them? Are you willing to refund unsold products back from failed salepeople (if a physical product exists) to help soften the financial blow? Does your company present those who leave as inferior or unworthy?

">MonaVie is a defunct, American multi-level marketing company that manufactured and distributed products made from blended fruit juice concentrates, powders, and purées. The company was the subject of several controversies. Health claims for its products had not been scientifically confirmed or approved by regulatory authorities, and its chairman had been previously involved in false health claims concerning another beverage company. According to Forbes, MonaVie's business plan resembled a pyramid scheme. In 2015, the company defaulted on a US$182 million loan and went into foreclosure. Florida-based Jeunesse Global took over MonaVie’s assets when it purchased the note for $15 million.

…

>The company, its executives, and various senior distributors have been part of significant lawsuits since the company's founding. MonaVie was the defendant in a false-advertising/trademark infringement suit against Imagenetix, Inc (2008), a multi-issue legal battle with Quixtar/Amway (2008), a false advertising suit by Oprah Winfrey and Mehmet Oz (2009), two class action lawsuits (2010, 2013), and a copyright infringement suit against Zrii (2010). Also, MonaVie filed several suits against former sales representatives for breach of contract.

"I was in Monat for several years.  I loved the products, but hated the business model.  They have about 10-12 different shampoos and most people only have an issue with ONE single line and that’s the Intense Repair Line which has just been renamed IR Clinical.  It was my personal fave shampoo but I used it once weekly.  People having issues were/are using it multiple times weekly.  If I had a new customer wanting that, I’d make them order another shampoo to use in between.  It has red clover extract in it which can irritate the scalp, especially if you have sensitive skin.  Again, use it once weekly you’ll be fine, daily will cause problems. The red clover extract is also in the IR spray/serum and the black 2n1 shampoo and conditioner.  It’s also the one line that really helps your hair grow.  An experienced rep can help someone learn how to use it but a brand new rep with no product education and advice from upline, will have customers with issues.  It can also be very drying so again good for once a week, not daily.  I hate the MLM business model and no longer involved but my hair did/does look fabulous and extremely healthy.  At the same time, I also learned how to take care of my hair.  Only washing every few days, using a heat protection, using a towel turban, hair oiling, etc which can all be done with any natural hair product brand and doesn’t need to be Monat.",0

"It sounds like Primerica....They don't give their real name out at first, in case you decide to Google their name. 

Main product is life insurance, but they offer a bunch of other ""financial services."" 

Once your friend says ""I'm changing my life,"" you know they are in an MLM...They basically paid a $220 fee, $25 recurring a month, and poof! They are now a financial advisor...with no schooling, training, experience, or knowledge whatsoever.",0
I’m dying to know this as well!! I haven’t heard anything before… Maybe they have some SERIOUS NDAs?,0
Once a company I worked for had to send out an apology because someone stole the list of employee contacts and their emergency contacts and tried to call all of them to sell some keto coffee MLM. They're beyond reason.,0
"They got free dessert for their “trouble”?
How about they offer to fix the swing. Dumbasses. :(",0
“No.”,0
Just be blunt but empathetic. Tell her your concerns and warn her to not “invest” any of her own money into this company. Maybe offer to help her with her resume or something nice like that.,0
I added the caption myself because I couldn't post a video here. I thought it was pretty funny I'm sure everyone who plays the game will encounter it,0

"Not to mention, she PAID to sponsor this post on Facebook, so her “business” must be down. It got 4 likes and 0 comments, so I’m guessing her sponsorship “investment” wasn’t worth it.",0
"I've posted this one before but it might fit:

We had a ""women's small business expo"" at the local mall a while back.I happened to be up there that morning not knowing it was going on.

Oh the vibe in that place was visible, the huns were practically glaring at the competition.  You could feel the temperature drop in places.

I think they didn't realize that there could be more than one hun in the area being a ""consultant"" for the same product.The legit businesses had a ""WTF did I get into"" look on their faces.",0
"Wow Blagglefarb, 😨 I THOUGHT we were **FRIENDS!!** 🙄😡 And now you won't 🙅‍♀️ ❌️ support us small businesses?!! 🏘💼🤳 


That's extremely TOXIC 🤢 and INSENSITIVE of you! 😤 I GUESS  I'll be the one to unfriend YOU!! 🤬😡 Good luck stuck at your 9-5 dead end job!🥱😒🏭",0
"""There's no other business model like this in the world."" 

Guess why.",0
"One of the many things Amway does is say “you shop from your own personal store by using partners as big as Apple, Walmart, etc..” but in reality, all reward programs work like that. If you get a credit card, they have partner brands that partner with them to incentivize you to shop Apple versus Samsung. It’s basic and Amway has not figured out some master anomaly. They also make you read books before actually figuring out what the company/scheme is to make sure you’re “dedicated”. These books are recycled down and worshipped as absolute truth. Both books you mentioned are great and provide a bunch of knowledge, but they are not absolute gospel as Amway claims. What is happening here is a person who is absolutely sold on the idea of financial freedom and leaving their terrible lives behind to sell you on the same idea. They are being coached to say everything, and I mean everything, by their up line. They come on as poised and knowledgeable but i guarantee they have no idea what they are saying. Run.",0
"Tupperware at least has a decent product, and if I don't have to buy it from a downline then it's basically just a normal, decent product at that point.

Stress incontinence is VERY common. Good to know the Facebook consultant is a medical professional.,0
"Ask her if it's Primerica.  They sell life insurance, and are an MLM.",0
How little has changed!,0
The fact that they got so defensive about a question about C19 cleaning protocol is a huge red flag. They sound difficult. Add to that the Norwex issue... I would have noped right out of that one. I have an Airbnb rental. All questions are answered with care and consideration. This person sounds a bit unhinged.,0
"It was fake, they wanted to cheer eachother on so they’d make money, so their up line would make money. I’d rather have no friends than fake friends",0
"IMHO this type of behaviour shows the huns are trying hard to convince *themselves,* rather than others. Hence most of their social media engagement comes from other huns - they're all reinforcing each other's brainwashing - and that's why you often see huns posting ""No negative comments allowed!"" coz they can't allow a dose of reality to break the facade.",0
"Ask if they are a fiduciary 100%, if they say ""yes"" ask them to sign off on a fiduciary oath (you can find a template online)

Ask about the all-in fees.  Are they loaded funds plus the internal fees.  Then have them compare that to an index fund that tracks the s&p 500 or NASDAQ.  Have them do a rule of 72 on the savings if you used an index fund.  Lol.

If it's ""managed"" ask for all-in cost.  Advisory management, planning, admin, misc fees and yes fund fees too.  Bring up the fiduciary topic here too.  Ask if the planning consists of tax planning.  

Ask them to break down the fees in those statements and explain the fund internal fees which may not show up.  You can ask how many of these funds beat the s&p 500 on a long-term basis.  

You can also ask about credentials such as CFP, ChFC, CFA, etc.",0
I don’t think they are. I remember when I used to work in a mall they had their own shop and I believe Sephora carries their brand as well.,0
"In the USA, send copies of the claim to the FTC and your state's fraud dpeartment. 

To find a fraud department, search Google for your state name and the word ""consumer fraud"" and then ""consumer protection"" ... usually the Attorney General's office or the insurance and securities commissioner is the spot. 

Some large states have an entire consumer protection office.",0

"""Not being time and financially free is hard"" is an absolute mess of a sentence. You'd think with all this free time and discretionary income, they'd be able to hire a skilled writer for their marketing materials. You know, like you do when you're running a legitimate business.",0
It’s Kangen / Enagic water machines. Total bullshit.,0
"Amway routinely tries to break up couples where only one is willing to join Amway. The non-Amway partner is described as all sorts of things behind their back, solely to the Amway partner: dream stealer, complication, dead weight, ""evidence you're not taking this seriously"", etc. SERIOUS cult shit. So yes, they give relationship advice. Always have.",0
Less than 10 people at the top rank out of 40k does not sell me.,0
"Keep a discreet eye on the situation. There are uplines who deliberately urge people to sneak behind their spouse's back and sign up on a separate credit card so that the spouse doesn't find out. **Not saying** your wife can't be trusted - the upline will mislead her by saying she should sign up in secret, be successful with her business and surprise you with all the money she makes.",0

"The concept of ""not my department"" eludes some people. Their lives are surely very interesting, having perfect knowledge and unlimited access to every aspect of their own workplace, as they surely must. Why else would they assume the rest of use have such knowledge and access in our workplaces?",0
That was kind of you and of the manager,0
That’s great lol. It’s not like you could have known why they were giving you drinks anyways,0
"Back when I was in college, I worked retail as an assistant manager for a big box retail store and I carried a lot of keys.  One day while working with the head honcho, the discussion of keys came up and the GM told me, there are three kinds of people, those without keys who don't have much responsibility.  Then there are those with lots of keys who are much more important, and finally there are those folks who don't carry keys, because someone else unlocks the doors for them...",0
The Hawaiian shirt guy had to be trolling! That was the icing on the cake for me. Thanks for the chuckle! 😂🤣😅,0

Which is it?  You stated you had them on a chain around your neck, but claim you're too young to wear them like that.",0

"One time I was at walmart in the cereal aisle looking at granola bars etc.   A lady also looking at that shelf commented something about maybe they don't sell corn meal anymore, which was too bad because she wanted to make cornbread.  I told her it was probably in the baking aisle with the flour, sugar, etc.    I already had the walmart app open so I did a quick search for her and was able to tell her what aisle to go to.",0

"""I'm wondering if we should have a conversation with YOUR manager about you harassing your customers.""

It just goes to prove that Walmart managers have no clue...they don't even recognize their employees.

"I worked a couple years collecting data information and was stationed in grocery stores, Wal Mart, Target and other similar places.    I had so many people come up and ask me if I worked for the company I was scanning for information.   I wore blue jeans and a t shirt with a hat and def didn't look like I worked there.   People would get pissed at me for nicely explaining I was not an employee of that store.    I had one guy ask me four times if I worked there as he seemed to think I was bullshitting him.    Also had a customer approach me screaming and yelling and continued after I told him I did not work for the store.   People suck sometimes.",0

Thing is, from the stories I've seen here, it doesn't matter what you're wearing. Looking like a punk? Some random Karen will still think you work in whatever store you're in. Have a labcoat on? Nah, you're an employee whos supposed to fill the shelves. Have an official, very obvious uniform of a different company or even a firemen uniform on? You **definitely** work here, even if you say you don't. Have a suit on? You're a manager, clearly - every Karen is going to scream in glee seeing ya!

There are weird, entitled people like that which are either too stupid or lost touch with reality. They just believe what they want, even if it's blatantly obvious how wrong they actually are.",0
You twisted your head all the way around behind you? Exorcist style? I love it. Too bad that didn’t send him screaming and running away.,0
That was very sweet of you. I hope you both stopped crying together.,0
"Laughing at the couple. I’m quite certain that a camouflage shirt looks nothing like a Walmart vest. I also had a I don’t work here experience in my early teens. I had a red outfit on in Staples. lol, at least in my case my outfit was the same colour as the store uniform at that time.",0

"I've had a similar experience. I've been working as a veterinary receptionist for many years now. The incident that happened to me was so long ago that people still used phone books to look up numbers and addresses. 

The conversation went something like this: 

Me: ""Thank you for calling (Name of Clinic), this is Resident\_Bitch, how may I help you?""  
Caller: ""Yes, how much is your senior discount?""  
Me: ""I'm sorry, sir, we don't offer a senior discount.""  
Caller: ""Yes you do! It says right here in your ad, Senior and military discounts available.""   
Me: ""I'm sorry, sir, but you must be looking at a different ad. We don't offer any discounts.""  
Caller: ""Yes, you do! It says right here, (Name of Different Clinic) Senior and military discounts available.""  
Me: ""Sir, you've called (Name of Clinic) not (Name of Different Clinic). We don't offer discounts here.""  
Caller: ""Then you're their answering service! Transfer my call to them!""  
Me: ""No, Sir. We are not their answering service. We are a completely different veterinary clinic and I cannot transfer your call. If you would like to reach them, you'll need to hang up the phone and dial their number that is listed in their ad.""  
Caller: Grumbles something unintelligible and hangs up. 

The ad for the clinic where I worked at was right next to the ad for the other clinic in the phone book and the guy had called my work's number while looking at the ad for the other one and just refused to admit making a mistake. 

Oh, and I now work at the clinic that advertised the senior and military discounts and our discounts suck.

I get stopped constantly, and I’ll usually help if I can, including trying to find an actual retail associate, but the number of people who get annoyed when I can’t help them or ignore when I say that I don’t know the answer is frustrating. It’s even more annoying that the department where I get stopped the most is the one where there is almost never a retail associate around.

My policy is that if the customer is polite, and I’m not in the middle of something time-sensitive, I’ll put in a little extra effort to help, but if they’re rude I’ll look around once and if I can’t find anyone just tell them I can’t help because we have different radio systems (not a lie, but I *can* call security to send someone over).",0

"I'm noticing a pattern, and I think my old job is to blame. The wall of marts over the years has gone through many uniform changes, but the one constant is the badge. Employees (at least for the 17 years I worked there) were given the option of either wearing it on the vest/chest (for the bit of time when they decided NO VESTS ONLY VARIOUS SHADES OF BLUE SHIRT) or on a lanyard. When there were vests, you were allowed to wear almost anything you wanted under it (which was awesome when you went on break because instant incognito until the customers got wise to it). The only identifying article that was almost a near constant was the lanyard. In the early days only managers had the lanyards too. So Karen's were able peg the managers right away! That only lasted a year, then they allowed all employees to wear them (presumably because the managers were tired of getting harassed for petty shit). So the lanyard is a dangerous thing. Made to wear around the neck but also a beacon of mistakes. (Edited from bacon)",0

"Decades ago, when dementia was just starting to showing it’s ugly head to my grandpa, he went by himself to run an errand and had to ask a stranger for help because he couldn’t find his way back home. This is a house that he built and had lived there for probably half a century at the time. 

Around Thanksgiving of 2020, my sister and I ran an errand and slowly drove by the gas station that was in the same parking lot. An elderly lady flagged me down and told me she was lost and couldn’t find her way home. She said she’d been driving for hours and had to get gas because it was pretty empty but the station didn’t take checks. She asked if I could pay for it and she’d write me a check. I agreed and told her it wasn’t necessary to pay me back because ‘tis the season and all. 

As she’s filling up, she asks me if I could give her directions to so she could get back home. I attempted to but it was too complicated for her. (We were in a suburb of the main city where she lived.) She asked if maybe I could lead her in my car until she was able to recognize where she’s at and able to find her way home. Thinking of my Grumps and how he found his way home because of a stranger, I decided to pay it forward. Since my sister was with me I told the woman I’d drive her home and my sister will follow. The round trip took about an hour and a half but it was worth it because she made it home safe and sound.

I like the wholesome stories. 🙂,0
One thing that helps me out if I'm at the gas station I work at on my day off is that my 3yo daughter is usually with me. Lol,0

"I happen to like these stories about people being confused but not angry. They are a lot closer to my own life experiences. 

Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy the stories with yelling, ""get the manager"", police, etc. But well written stories like this are just as nice to read. 

Thanks",0
"I used to work in a small retail store for 4 years. I was the manager so I spent a lot of time there, had dreams of the place for years afterwards.

Some time later, I'm there shopping and catching up with my old coworkers.  The door chimes. I turn to the door, see a customer, and cheerfully say ""Hey there! What can I help you find?""

\*Oh god, I-- I dont work here.\*  My coworkers all busted up laughing and couldn't control themselves, to the point where we had to explain to that poor customer what happened. I remember how embarrassed I was for some reason. Pretty funny looking back.",0
[deleted],0
"It makes my blood boil the way that these customers talk to people they believe are employees. Like even if you were an employee, what gives her the right to berate you?  


Sorry this happened to you. Did the cashier or anyone say anything after the fact?",0
"I still find baffling how those people have the confidence and gall to do such things even when they have been pointed out how wrong they were.

Totally baffling...",0
"I get the ""Are you an employee?"". People are in a hurry, preoccupied with stuff that they aren't able to differentiate between staff and customer, etc. But ""Are you sure?"", come on. Really? Why would you ask that? Like what do you expect? Do they think the staff like to lie and hide from their responsibility.",0
"Welllll since you’re in high school you don’t have the world experience yet- but on college campuses people will ask anyone directions somewhere.

"My son worked in a store for a large hardware chain years ago.

"This is totally believable.

I worked in fast food drive thru for years in the early 2000s, both as crew and later as a shift manager. It was fairly regular for customers to demand drinks and sandwiches from other chains, and it got to the point with some upper management insisted if we could figure it out, we should make them anyway.

Didn't always work. We got the weirdest complaints because of it.

It seems no matter how much people told them, some insisted we sold items we did not. ... Some even would call us, a phone number clearly associated with $Store_chain with a robot clearly explaining they were calling $Store_chain and retort when told we didn't carry those items that as we were $Other_chain we *did* carry the items.

I mean, the logo of the chain was even printed on the receipt paper, but they still insisted.

Some people are just *this* stupid, and it BURNS.",0

This sounds like Celebrate Brooklyn. I saw the New Pornographers there for $3! Good deal!,0
"Why do so many people just assume that non-employees are lying when they say they don't work there?  Has there been a single instance where an employee did lie about where they worked and someone busted them?

I don't mean the lazy employees who just pass everything off to their coworkers, I mean someone wearing the uniform with the badge/lanyard who just looked someone in the eyes and lied about working there while on the clock.",0

I'm impressed that you are willing to admit it publicly. Lol,0

"Did similar to this many years ago. I worked for a chain pizza place. I was on vacation and the local branch of same chain was slammed. They had something like a two hour wait while three people tried to please the crowd. You could tell they were not used to any type of rush. The branch I managed was in a larger city and I was familiar and comfortable with lots of orders. 

I grabbed the manager who was trying to keep up on making food. I offered my assistance in return for my order for free. He took me up on the offer. After 40 minutes i had all his boards cleared. I then gave him advice on what to do for the rest of the week. When I stopped in a few days later he had taken my advice. He still was struggling but not as bad. That time it only took me 25 minutes to clear his boards.",0

Doesn't everyone working at the supermarket wear a backpack?  ;),0
Well you're ahead of 95% of stories here because you noticed and apologized :),0
Would have been perfect if after she said “oh you mean me?” You whirl around and go “Yeah! That’s her! That’s the one being a bitch” while you point her out to the manager. Then just be like “have the day you deserve ma’am” and walk away lol.,0

"My friend gave some lady like this a number and said ""She can speak with you now, if you need."" Lady called and after hearing ""hello"" proceeded to go on a five minute tirade. During this five minute tirade, dude is walking around being followed by karen while he shops, his wife appears, and when karen finally takes oxygen into her body (and brain), the wife says into her own cell phone ""I know this is hard for you to comprehend, but my husband is shopping with me. F--- off before I punch you in the face"", hung up the phone and stared down karen, clearly hoping she'd have an excuse. Wife had been having a bad day...

Karen was smart enough for once to silently walk the hell away and husband asked if she wanted her fave ice cream and chocolate, lol.",0
There’s a grocery store not far from me (2 blocks) I shop at all the time. I’m an old fatter white guy in shorts and a T-shirt. for some reason I get asked quite often where items are. I KNOW the store and always point them to the right direction. Not sure if they think I work there or what.,0

>  
>I was walking around the fest grounds aimlessly and noticed how most the workers wore casual clothing( tshirt with a logo of what church they’re from, security, etc.) while others are in jeans, polos and held a walkie talkie but all of them had lanyards. I made my way back towards the rides where I got my niece a balloon animal and I wanted a caricature. To avoid getting a heat stroke and to beat the heat I proceeded to walk behind the tent canopies they set up and walk in the shade but I stopped when I saw an ATV( I get excited about certain vehicles) but what confused me was why I saw two kids randomly sitting on it.   
>  
>While my brain’s still processing what’s in front of me, I hear in a surprising twist “excuse me, sir.” And standing before me is a woman in her 40s-50s with a walkie talkie in hand. She then explains that the two kids I saw were accidentally left behind by their parents. And because of the stress in this situation she asked if I could get them some balloon animals to make them feel better until their parents get back.   
>  
>I blinked in amazement over the whole situation and in my silence she took another look at me and asked do you work here? I told her I don’t but I’m willing to help out by getting the kids balloon animals she said no but thanked me for the offer.

Nice story OP. I'm one of those people who *need* paragraphs in their stories. When I come across a post like your post, I copy and past it into a comment and add paragraphs.

There was still a lot of people waiting for food.

Of the group of people I was with a bunch of us worked at a Perkins, some even worked at that one. The ones that worked there jumped on the line and started helping the cooks, while a couple others began bussing tables another wiping them down. I jumped back in the dish area which was just overflowing with dirty dishes and got started. It's amazing how fast you can work after you've been out partying and still holding a good buzz! Lol

All I can say is perhaps there was a small mix up at the farm... like what the hell do you want from me lady.

Then she flips over the bag, as there are mesh screens on the back to see the potatoes 🥔... see , there and there.

They said of course you can. So I pointed to the sign and said I was worried this meant I couldn’t.

His leg needed 18 months before it was back to full strength.[10]

In September 2000, Bradbury broke his neck in a training accident. Another skater fell in front of him and Bradbury tried to jump over him, but instead clipped him and tripped head first into the barriers. As a result, Bradbury fractured his C4 and C5 vertebrae. He spent a month and a half in a halo brace, and needed four pins to be inserted in his skull and screws and plates bolted into his back and chest.[13] Doctors told Bradbury that he would not be able to take to the ice again, but he was determined to reach another Olympics.

After consulting his national coach Ann Zhang, Bradbury's strategy from the semi-final onwards was to cruise behind his opponents and hope that they crashed, as he could not match their pace.[15] His reasoning was that risk-taking by the favourites could cause a collision due to a racing incident, and if two or more skaters fell, the remaining three would all get medals, and that as he was slower than his opponents, trying to challenge them directly would only increase his own chances of falling.[15][16] Bradbury said that he was satisfied with his result, and felt that as the second-oldest competitor in the field, he was not able to match his opponents in four races on the same night.[17]

In his semi-final race, Bradbury was in last place, well off the pace of the medal favourites. However, defending champion Kim Dong-sung of South Korea, multiple Olympic medallist Li Jiajun of China and Mathieu Turcotte of Canada all crashed, paving the way for Bradbury to take first place and advancing him through to the final.

In the final, Bradbury was again well off the pace when all four of his competitors (Ohno, Ahn Hyun-Soo, Li and Turcotte) crashed out at the final corner while jostling for the gold medal. This allowed Bradbury, who was around 15 m behind with only 50 m to go, to avoid the pile-up and take the victory.[15][16][18] Bradbury became the first person from a southern hemisphere country to win a Winter Olympic event.",0

"So I was working the night audit shift at a hotel once. A guest called me at the front desk and said ""Uh, yeah, there's something going on here on the fourth floor... you should get up here.""

Before I even got off the elevator I could hear the yelling. Freaky Yoko Ono like siren wails. I walked around the corner to the hallway and there were two men, in their underwear, shouting gibberish at each other and clawing at the walls.

Now, I've taken mushrooms and LSD before, but I've never had a freakout like this. And they were obviously freaking out on... something.

I assessed that things were at 5 on the Hunter S. Thompson scale and just shouted ""THE POLICE!!... are on their way."" I hadn't called them yet, but if this was going to continue, I knew I'd have to.

Well, these two cretins looked at me like they were cockroaches who just got caught when someone turned the lights on and had a can of Raid in their hands.

They then scurried right for the stairs at the end of the hall. I ran after them, but by the time I was on the 2nd floor, they had gotten to the ground floor exit and left the hotel. I went back to the hallway to look out the window at our parking lot and I saw them, still in their underwear in what must have been like 40 degree temperature, jump into a car and drive away.

Once the butt hits the ground they have the control to lower it in a safe direction, or continue tying off the butt end higher up and chopping the bottom with a slash cut. It's a big brain tree removal strategy.

Edit: Someone pointed out the chain link fence which is more than likely why they chose this method, as felling wasn't an option. The tree could also have root upheaval or rot which would make it unsafe to climb. And given the location a bucket truck wouldn't have good or any access.",0

"Warm-glow messaging can be used to encourage repeat blood donations in a variety of ways. For example, messages can be sent out to thank people for their donations, or to remind them of the positive feelings they experienced after giving blood. Additionally, organizations can host events and activities that further emphasize the positive feelings associated with donating blood, such as recognition ceremonies or celebratory events. 

Organizations can also use social media to promote the warm-glow feeling associated with donating blood. Posts that highlight the positive impact of blood donations, such as a patient’s recovery story, can be shared to encourage others to donate. Additionally, organizations can post photos and videos of people donating blood to show the positive emotions associated with the act. 

Finally, organizations can also use warm-glow messaging in their marketing campaigns. Ads and posters that emphasize the positive feelings associated with donating blood can be used to encourage people to donate again. Additionally, organizations can create campaigns that focus on the community benefits of donating blood, such as helping those in need or saving lives. 

Overall, warm-glow messaging is a powerful tool for increasing repeat blood donations. By emphasizing the positive emotions associated with donating blood, organizations can encourage people to donate again and help save lives.",1

The study also found that the vaccine was 80% effective in preventing COVID-19 infection, and that the risk of severe illness was reduced by 90%. 

The study authors concluded that the updated COVID-19 vaccine was highly effective in protecting children against both mild and severe COVID-19 illness. They also noted that the vaccine was well tolerated and had a good safety profile, with no serious side effects reported. The authors said their findings suggest that the vaccine should be offered to children as soon as possible to protect them from the virus.",1

The lancet liver fluke (Dicrocoelium dendriticum) is a parasite that infects the liver of grazing animals like sheep, cows and goats. It is spread by a snail, which serves as an intermediate host. The parasite can also infect ants, which are then eaten by grazing animals, completing the lifecycle.

This brain-altering parasite has been found to take over the brains of ants, causing them to cling to blades of grass against their will. The ants are compelled to climb to the tips of grass blades, where they are more likely to be eaten by grazing animals.

Once inside the grazing animal, the parasite will migrate to the liver and reproduce. The researchers hypothesize that the parasite has evolved to manipulate the behavior of ants in order to increase its chances of transmission to a suitable host.

The researchers found that the infected ants climb to the tips of grass blades at night, when the temperature is cooler, and remain there until the next morning. This behavior is very different from the behavior of uninfected ants, which usually remain on the ground.

The lancet liver fluke is the first known parasite to use this strategy of manipulating the behavior of its host to increase its chances of transmission. The researchers believe that this strategy may be more common than previously thought, and that other parasites may use similar strategies to increase their transmission rates.",1

Insects can transmit plant viruses through a process called vector-mediated transmission. When an insect feeds on an infected plant, the virus can enter the insect’s body and replicate in its cells. In some cases, the virus can induce changes in the insect’s behavior, such as increased activity and prolonged feeding, which can help the virus spread to other plants. For example, the cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) can cause infected insects to feed for longer and move around more, allowing them to spread the virus to other plants.",1
"Background: Low-carbohydrate diets are increasingly popular for weight loss and chronic disease prevention, but their effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality remain unclear.

Objective: To systematically review and meta-analyze the evidence of the association between low-carbohydrate diets and risk of CVD, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality.

Search Strategy: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases for studies published up to Sept 2023.

Inclusion Criteria: We included prospective cohort studies that reported risk estimates for CVD, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality associated with low-carbohydrate diets.

Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two independent reviewers extracted the risk estimates and conducted a random-effects meta-analysis.

Results: We identified 11 studies with a total of 1,004,619 participants and 28,841 CVD, 6,972 cardiovascular mortality, and 33,683 all-cause mortality events. The pooled relative risks (RRs) for CVD, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality associated with low-carbohydrate diets were 0.97 (95% CI 0.93–1.02), 0.94 (95% CI 0.86–1.02), and 0.99 (95% CI 0.96–1.02), respectively. There was no evidence of heterogeneity or publication bias.

Conclusion: Our findings suggest that low-carbohydrate diets are not associated with an increased risk of CVD, cardiovascular mortality, or all-cause mortality. Long-term studies are needed to confirm these findings.",1
"In a study published in the Journal of Neuroinflammation in September 2023, researchers from the Institute of Neuroscience and the Second Military Medical University in Shanghai, China investigated the antidepressant-like effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) on learned helplessness rats. The team found that BHB infusion produced antidepressant-like effects that were associated with increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and TrkB receptor expression, as well as increased levels of glutamate receptor AMPA in the hippocampus. Furthermore, BHB improved learning ability in the rats.

The team administered BHB to rats that had been subjected to learned helplessness stress. They found that BHB infusion reduced the immobility time in the rats, which is a measure of depression-like behavior. They also found that the BHB infusion reduced the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome, which is known to be involved in depressive behavior. Furthermore, BHB infusion increased the expression of BDNF and TrkB in the hippocampus, as well as the expression of AMPA glutamate receptor in the hippocampus.

The team then examined the effects of BHB infusion on learning ability. They found that BHB infusion improved the rats’ performance in the Morris water maze, a test used to measure learning and memory.

Overall, the findings of the study suggest that BHB infusion produces antidepressant-like effects on learned helplessness rats through BDNF-TrkB signaling and AMPA receptor activation, and strengthens learning ability. This could be a promising new target for the development of novel antidepressant medications.",1
"A brain-altering parasite called Ophiocordyceps unilateralis is known to infect certain species of ants and turn them into ""zombie"" ants. The parasite infects the ant's brain and alters its behavior, causing the ant to climb up a plant stem and stay there until it dies. The affected ant will remain in this position during the day and night, but is most active around dawn and dusk. During these times, the ant will bite onto the stem and die, allowing the fungus to spread its spores and spread to other ants.",1
"This study, which was published in the journal Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, found that when people witness someone else experiencing pain, they experience subliminal fear and avoidance responses. Participants in the study were shown images of people in pain and images of people in non-painful situations. When the images of people in pain were presented, the participants had increased activity in the amygdala, a region of the brain associated with fear and avoidance responses. This suggests that when we witness someone in pain, our bodies instinctively respond with fear and avoidance. The study also found that these responses were greater when the participants had felt empathy towards the person in pain. This suggests that our experience of empathy can influence our subliminal responses to witnessing pain.",1

"Tomatidine and tomatine are steroidal alkaloids found in unripe tomatoes. Recent studies have suggested that these compounds may have antidepressant-like effects. In this study, we examined the effects of tomatidine and tomatine on the activation of mTORC1, a major regulator of synaptic plasticity, in the medial prefrontal cortex of lipopolysaccharide-induced depression model mice. The results showed that treatment with tomatidine and tomatine significantly increased the expression of mTORC1 in the medial prefrontal cortex of mice. Moreover, treatment with tomatidine and tomatine significantly decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) in the serum. These findings suggest that tomatidine and tomatine may have antidepressant-like effects via activation of mTORC1 in the medial prefrontal cortex in lipopolysaccharide-induced depression model mice. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of action of tomatidine and tomatine in the treatment of depression.",1

Specifically, metformin induces a shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation in DCs, which results in the generation of ATP and the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. This shift towards metabolic reprogramming is believed to be the key mediator of the tolerogenic properties of metformin-treated DCs. Thus, metformin may prove to be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.",1
"This study aims to investigate the long-term effectiveness and seizure recurrence risk factors of the ketogenic diet for pediatric refractory epilepsy. The study will be conducted at a tertiary care center in China and will include a total of 200 children. The children will be followed up for an average of 48 months after initiating the ketogenic diet. The primary outcome measure will be the proportion of patients who have achieved seizure freedom and the time to seizure recurrence. Secondary outcome measures will include the duration of seizure freedom, seizure frequency, seizure severity, and other relevant clinical outcomes.

We will also assess potential risk factors associated with seizure recurrence, including age, gender, duration of ketogenic diet, types of epilepsy, and other demographic and clinical characteristics. We will use descriptive and multivariate analysis to examine the relationship between potential risk factors and seizure recurrence.

We expect to find that the ketogenic diet is an effective treatment for pediatric refractory epilepsy, with a high proportion of patients achieving seizure freedom. We also expect to identify risk factors associated with seizure recurrence, which may help clinicians better tailor the treatment to individual patients. The results of this study will provide important information for the clinical practice of pediatric epilepsy.",1

"A 20-year experiment conducted by researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, has found that actively replanting logged tropical forests with mixtures of seedlings can be more effective than natural recovery for restoring forest canopy area and biomass. The study, which was published in the journal Nature Sustainability, found that the higher the diversity of replanted tree species, the more canopy area and biomass was recovered.

The researchers planted a total of 32,000 seedlings in parcels of logged forest in the lowland tropical rainforest of Sumatra, Indonesia, in 1998 and then monitored the parcels for 20 years. They found that parcels with a high diversity of replanted species had recovered more than twice as much canopy area and biomass than parcels with a low diversity of replanted species.

The findings suggest that actively replanting logged tropical forests with a diversity of tree species could be an effective way to restore degraded areas and help mitigate the impacts of climate change. The researchers noted that replanting logged forests can be expensive, but said that it can be cost-effective if the value of the restored ecosystem services is taken into account.",1
"The goal is to create a more efficient and accurate AI system that can respond to multiple stimuli, such as images and tactile inputs. The artificial neuron combines a photodiode, which detects light, and a piezoelectric material, which detects mechanical pressure. The photodiode is used to detect light and the piezoelectric material is used to detect mechanical pressure. By combining these two sensors, the artificial neuron can process both visual and tactile inputs together. The result is an AI system that can respond to multiple stimuli and learn from them. Additionally, the artificial neuron is energy-efficient, which is important for AI systems. This type of research could lead to more efficient AI systems with improved accuracy.",1
"Solar ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation has been shown to promote the secretion of the hormone α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH). α-MSH has been demonstrated to reduce the inflammatory response of type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s). This suggests that UVB radiation might attenuate the function of ILC2s through the pituitary–lung axis. To test this hypothesis, a study could be conducted in which mice are exposed to UVB radiation and then the levels of α-MSH and ILC2 activity are assessed. Additionally, the impact of α-MSH on ILC2 activity could be evaluated by administering exogenous α-MSH to the mice and measuring changes in ILC2 activity. Such a study could provide insights into how UVB radiation affects the immune system and could potentially lead to the development of novel therapies for allergies and asthma.",1
"Recent research has demonstrated that fluctuations in cortical state can have a significant impact on sensory processing in the human temporal lobe. Specifically, it has been found that endogenous fluctuations in cortical state selectively enhance different modes of sensory processing in the temporal lobe. For instance, when the cortical state is in a more aroused state, sensory processing is enhanced for stimuli that are highly salient or that require more detailed processing, while stimuli with lower salience or that require less detailed processing are not as strongly affected. Additionally, when the cortical state is in a less aroused state, sensory processing is enhanced for stimuli that are less salient and require less detailed processing, while stimuli with higher salience or that require more detailed processing are not as strongly affected. This suggests that fluctuations in cortical state can be used to selectively enhance different types of sensory processing in the temporal lobe.",1
"The influence of number of pedestrians, waiting time, and obstacles on the experience of waiting in crowded places is a complex issue. The number of pedestrians in a crowded place can have a significant impact on the overall experience of waiting, as more people in the same space can lead to increased levels of stress and discomfort. The amount of time spent waiting can also affect the experience, as longer wait times can lead to increased levels of boredom, frustration, and restlessness. Moreover, obstacles such as furniture or other physical objects can also influence the experience of waiting, as they can impede the movement of people in the area and cause frustration. 

For example, a study conducted by the University of California found that the number of people in a crowded place had a significant effect on the overall experience of waiting. The study found that when the number of people in a crowded place was increased, the level of perceived stress and discomfort also increased. Similarly, the study also found that longer wait times led to increased levels of boredom, frustration, and restlessness. Finally, the study found that obstacles such as furniture or other physical objects hindered the movement of people in the area, leading to increased levels of frustration and discomfort. 

Overall, the influence of number of pedestrians, waiting time, and obstacles on the experience of waiting in crowded places is significant, as each of these factors can have a significant impact on the overall experience. As such, it is important for public spaces to consider these factors when designing and managing crowded places, in order to ensure that the experience of waiting is as comfortable and stress-free as possible.",1
"The study found that women who used urine ovulation tests were more likely to become pregnant than those who did not use them. This was especially true for women under 40. The study also found that the chances of a live birth were higher for those who used urine ovulation tests (28%) than those who did not (18%).

Overall, the study concluded that using urine ovulation tests to time intercourse around the fertile period can increase pregnancy and live birth rates in women under 40 trying to conceive for under 12 months.",1
"In a recent study published in Cell Metabolism, researchers found that CD44, a cell surface receptor, is a marker of longevity and that its overexpression increases basal activity of activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and enhances resistance to ER stress. The study showed that in mice, CD44 overexpression extends lifespan and is associated with increased expression of genes related to ER stress resistance. They also found that CD44 overexpression leads to increased basal ATF6 activity, which in turn activates the unfolded protein response and increases ER stress resistance. These findings suggest that CD44 could be a potential target for interventions to extend lifespan and reduce the risk of diseases associated with ER stress.",1
"Carbonaceous dust grains are one of the most common types of dust grains in the universe, and they are thought to have been present since the very first moments of cosmic time. These dust grains are composed mostly of carbon, and they are believed to have been formed from the outflows of massive stars and supernovae. The presence of these dust grains can be seen in the early stages of star formation, and they are thought to play an important role in the formation and evolution of galaxies. Carbonaceous dust grains are also important for interstellar chemistry, as they can act as catalysts for the formation of molecules such as CO and H2.",1
"In a study published in September 2023, researchers examined the relationship between cold-stimulated brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation and changes in serum metabolites relevant to NAD+ metabolism in humans. The study was conducted with a small sample of healthy adult male volunteers who underwent a cold-exposure test of 4°C for two hours. Using a combination of metabolomics and stable isotope tracers, the researchers measured changes in the concentrations of the NAD+ precursors nicotinamide riboside and nicotinamide mononucleotide, as well as NAD+ and NADH, in the participants' serum samples.

The results showed that cold-stimulated BAT activation was associated with a decrease in the NAD+/NADH ratio and an increase in the concentrations of both nicotinamide riboside and nicotinamide mononucleotide. This suggested that the activation of BAT in response to cold exposure was accompanied by changes in the availability of NAD+ precursors in the bloodstream, which could be used to produce more NAD+ in the mitochondria.

Overall, this study provided new insight into the relationship between cold-stimulated BAT activation and changes in serum metabolites relevant to NAD+ metabolism in humans. This could potentially be used in the development of new strategies for improving BAT activity and increasing energy expenditure.",1

"The aging process of microglia, the primary immune cells of the central nervous system, is still poorly understood. Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled a deeper understanding of the molecular basis of aging in microglia. In this review, we discuss recent findings on the transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of microglial aging. We first describe the transcriptional programs associated with microglial aging, focusing on the role of gene expression changes in the regulation of microglial function. We then discuss the involvement of epigenetic modifications in the regulation of microglial aging, with a particular focus on histone modifications and DNA methylation. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of these findings for therapeutic interventions targeting microglial aging. Our review provides a comprehensive overview of the transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms underlying the aging process in microglia, highlighting the complexity of this process and the potential for targeted interventions to modify microglial aging.",1
"In recent years, researchers have identified a range of gene expression programs associated with aging and age-related diseases. These programs often involve increased inflammation and a shift in fatty acid metabolism. 

To address these age-related changes, geroprotective interventions are now being developed to target these gene expression programs. These interventions typically involve lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise and a healthy diet, as well as pharmacological treatments, such as statins and anti-inflammatory drugs. 

The goal of these interventions is to reduce inflammation and restore fatty acid metabolism to more youthful levels. To do this, researchers are looking at both traditional and novel approaches. Traditional approaches involve modulating the activity of known genes and pathways, while novel approaches are exploring the use of gene-editing technologies to modify key gene expression programs. 

In addition, researchers are also looking into ways to enhance the protective effects of these interventions, such as by combining them with other treatments, such as hormone replacement therapy or nutritional supplements.

As these interventions continue to be developed and tested in clinical trials, it is expected that they will eventually converge on a set of gene expression programs that will help to reduce inflammation and restore fatty acid metabolism to more youthful levels. This could potentially lead to improved health and longevity in the elderly population.",1
"Hypertension is a major public health concern, as it increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and target organ damage. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a key mediator in the development of hypertension-induced target organ damage. Natural products and formulations have shown promise in modulating NLRP3 inflammasome activity and, consequently, reducing associated damage. This review aims to discuss the potential of natural products and formulations in targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome for the treatment of hypertensive target organ damage. The review will provide an overview of the role of NLRP3 in hypertension-induced damage and the potential of natural products to modulate its activity.

"The circadian clock is an endogenous timing system that regulates diverse metabolic processes, including glucose and lipid metabolism, in the liver. Recent research suggests that the circadian clock is also affected by the gut microbiome. The gut microbiome is composed of a diverse population of bacteria that help to regulate metabolism and other physiological processes. Studies have suggested that gut microbes may influence the circadian clock and, in turn, affect glucose and lipid metabolism in the liver.

For example, a recent study published in Cell Metabolism found that mice with an altered gut microbiome had impaired liver circadian clock function, leading to abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism. The authors suggest that the gut microbiome mediates the communication between the liver and the circadian clock, and that disturbances in the gut microbiome can lead to metabolic dysregulation.

In addition, other studies have shown that certain gut bacteria can directly affect glucose and lipid metabolism in the liver. For instance, certain bacteria can promote the production of short-chain fatty acids, which can improve liver lipid metabolism.

Overall, these studies suggest that the gut microbiome plays an important role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism in the liver, and that disturbances in the microbiome can lead to metabolic dysregulation. As such, understanding the relationship between the gut microbiome and the liver circadian clock is essential for developing new treatments for metabolic disorders.",1
"Gradient cell–structured alloys are a new class of materials which have the potential to exhibit superior properties compared to conventional alloys. In this work, we study the cryogenic strain hardening response of a gradient cell–structured alloy under atomic faulting. We show that atomic faulting induces exceptional cryogenic strain hardening in the gradient cell–structured alloy, which is significantly higher than that of conventional alloys. We attribute this superior strain hardening response to the unique microstructure of the gradient cell–structured alloy, which is composed of alternating layers of high-strength and low-strength materials. Our results demonstrate the potential of gradient cell–structured alloys for applications where cryogenic strain hardening is desirable, such as aerospace and automotive components.",1
"Seasonal changes in light hours have been shown to have a significant effect on the peripheral clocks and energy metabolism of mice. Studies have demonstrated that the photoperiod, or the length of the day, is a major factor in the regulation of a variety of physiological processes in mice, including energy metabolism and the activity of peripheral clocks.

In one study, researchers used a novel technique to measure the effects of seasonal changes in the photoperiod on the peripheral clocks and energy metabolism of mice. The mice were exposed to both summer and winter photoperiods for a period of two months. The results showed that the mice exposed to the winter photoperiod had significantly lower body temperatures and increased fatty acid oxidation in the liver, which suggests that seasonal light hours can impact metabolic processes in mice.

The results of this study suggest that the seasonal changes in the photoperiod have a significant effect on the peripheral clocks and energy metabolism of mice. This could have implications for our understanding of the effects of seasonal changes in the photoperiod on other organisms, including humans. Further research is needed to understand the full effects of seasonal light hours on metabolism and peripheral clocks.",1
"1. Lipidome alterations associated with cardiovascular disease: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are associated with changes in the composition and levels of various lipids, such as triglycerides, cholesterol, phospholipids, and sphingolipids. Dyslipidemia, characterized by abnormal levels of lipids, is linked to increased risk of CVD.

2. Lipidome alterations associated with diabetes: Diabetes is associated with several changes in the lipidome, including increased levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids, and decreased levels of phospholipids. These changes are linked to the development of diabetic complications such as nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy.

3. Lipidome alterations associated with obesity: Obesity is associated with alterations in the lipidome, including increased levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and free fatty acids, and decreased levels of phospholipids. These changes are linked to the development of metabolic syndrome and other obesity-related diseases.

"The purpose of this research is to investigate the integration of methylome and proteome data in human skeletal muscle in order to uncover group and individual responses to high-intensity interval training (HIIT). High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is a form of exercise characterized by repeated bouts of high-intensity exercise interspersed with short periods of rest or low-intensity activity. This type of exercise has become increasingly popular as an effective and time-efficient way to improve physical fitness. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the beneficial effects of HIIT are still largely unknown.

In this study, we will use a combination of high-throughput technologies to measure and compare the methylome and proteome profiles of human skeletal muscle before and after HIIT in a group of healthy volunteers. We will use genomic sequencing to identify differentially methylated regions and mass spectrometry to measure the abundance of proteins in skeletal muscle, and then integrate these data to identify changes in gene expression profiles in response to HIIT. We will also assess individual differences in response to HIIT, and explore whether any of these differences are associated with specific methylation or protein abundance patterns.

By integrating methylome and proteome data, this study will provide a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying HIIT-induced changes in human skeletal muscle. The results of this study will provide valuable insight into the potential of HIIT as an effective exercise intervention for improving physical fitness, and will help to inform the development of personalized exercise programs tailored to individual needs.",1
", potentially helping to completely remove the cancer. The process involves attaching a charged molecule to a small peptide, which is then used to bind to the cancer cells. Once it binds, the electrical charge triggers the cancer cells to self-destruct, killing them in the process. This technique could be used in combination with other treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation, to increase the chances of a successful outcome.",1
".

The research, which was conducted by the University of Exeter, found that while Facebook’s efforts to remove anti-vaccine content did lead to a decrease in the overall volume of anti-vaccine posts, the engagement with these posts remained at a similar level to pre-pandemic levels. 

The research also found that the removal of anti-vaccine content had little to no effect on the overall engagement with pro-vaccine content. This suggests that while Facebook was able to reduce the overall volume of anti-vaccine content, it did not significantly reduce the amount of engagement with this content.

The research also highlighted the need for further research to understand how the removal of anti-vaccine content impacts the public’s attitudes towards vaccines. The researchers argued that while the removal of anti-vaccine content may reduce the amount of misinformation about vaccines, it does not necessarily lead to an increase in pro-vaccine attitudes.",1
"The skeletal muscle response to exercise is complex and involves changes in gene expression, protein synthesis, and metabolic pathways. Recent studies have shown that the skeletal muscle response to exercise is discordant, meaning that changes in gene expression and protein synthesis do not always correlate with one another.

Gene expression studies have shown that there are several genes that are upregulated in response to exercise, including genes involved in muscle growth and repair, inflammation, and metabolic pathways. These changes in gene expression are thought to be important for muscle adaptation and recovery following exercise.

Protein synthesis studies have also shown that there are changes in the abundance of proteins in the muscle following exercise. These changes include increases in proteins involved in muscle contraction, energy metabolism, and muscle repair.

However, the changes in gene expression and protein synthesis do not always correlate with one another, suggesting that the muscle’s response to exercise is discordant. This discordance may be due to the fact that the gene expression and protein synthesis responses to exercise are regulated by different pathways and involve different cellular processes.

It is important to understand the discordant responses of skeletal muscle to exercise in order to better understand the mechanisms of muscle adaptation and recovery following exercise. Further research is needed to better characterize the discordant skeletal muscle responses to exercise and to identify the underlying mechanisms that govern these responses.",1
"The study was conducted by researchers at the University of Cambridge and published in the journal Cell Reports.

The findings of the study suggest that Parkinson’s disease may be a consequence of synaptic dysfunction and not caused by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. The researchers used microscopic imaging techniques to study the dopamine-producing neurons in the brains of mice with a genetic mutation that causes Parkinson’s-like symptoms. They found that the neurons were normal but had impaired synapses.

The researchers also used a chemical compound to mimic the effects of Parkinson’s in the mice and observed similar changes in the synapses. This led them to conclude that synaptic dysfunction precedes and may be responsible for the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons.

The findings of this study suggest that therapies targeting synaptic dysfunction may be effective in treating Parkinson’s disease. The researchers are now investigating the molecular mechanisms that underlie synaptic dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease and how it could be targeted with therapeutic interventions.",1
"Background

Physical exercise has become an increasingly popular intervention for improving the physical and mental health of children and adolescents with disabilities. However, the effects of physical exercise on inferiority feeling in this population remain largely unknown. Inferiority feeling is a feeling of inadequacy or inferiority compared to others and can lead to negative consequences. This study seeks to explore the chain-mediated effects of self-depletion and self-efficacy on the effects of physical exercise on inferiority feeling in children and adolescents with disabilities.

Methods

This study will use a longitudinal design to examine the effects of physical exercise on inferiority feeling in children and adolescents with disabilities. The participants will be recruited from a variety of sources, including schools, clinics, and other organizations. Participants will be randomly assigned to either an experimental or control group. The experimental group will participate in a 12-week physical exercise program, while the control group will not. Both groups will complete pre- and post-tests measuring self-depletion, self-efficacy, and inferiority feeling.

Results

The results of this study will provide insight into the chain-mediated effects of physical exercise on inferiority feeling in children and adolescents with disabilities. It is expected that the experimental group will experience a decrease in inferiority feeling, as well as an increase in self-efficacy and self-depletion.

Conclusion

The results of this study will provide insight into the effects of physical exercise on inferiority feeling in children and adolescents with disabilities. It is expected that the experimental group will experience a decrease in inferiority feeling, as well as an increase in self-efficacy and self-depletion. This research will also provide information about the chain-mediated effects of physical exercise on inferiority feeling, and will help inform future interventions for this population.",1

"Contour properties of a scene, such as line width, color, and texture, can have a significant effect on how aesthetically pleasing a scene is perceived to be. Changing one or more of these properties can drastically alter the overall aesthetic quality of a scene. For example, increasing the line width of an image can create a sense of depth and draw the viewer’s eye to specific elements of the image. Similarly, changing the color of a scene can create a more vibrant and dynamic atmosphere. Lastly, altering the texture of a scene can make an image appear more or less realistic, depending on the desired effect. By making small changes to the contour properties of a scene, viewers can significantly alter the aesthetic impact of a scene.",1
"Nanomicelle curcumin is a powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent that has been used in traditional medicine for centuries. In recent years, its use has been extended to various clinical applications, including cancer treatments, inflammatory diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. However, its use has also been linked to some adverse side effects, such as testicular toxicity. This review focuses on the potential mechanisms underlying the testicular toxicity induced by nanomicelle curcumin, with particular attention to mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy.

The first potential mechanism of nanomicelle curcumin-induced testicular toxicity relates to its ability to induce oxidative stress and redox imbalance. Nanomicelle curcumin is known to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in the testes, which can lead to increased oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis. This can result in decreased spermatogenesis, decreased sperm motility, and increased testicular apoptosis. Furthermore, nanomicelle curcumin has been shown to inhibit the activity of antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase, which further exacerbates the redox imbalance.

The second potential mechanism of nanomicelle curcumin-induced testicular toxicity relates to its ability to alter mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy. Nanomicelle curcumin has been shown to reduce the expression of the mitochondrial biogenesis factors PGC-1α and ERRα, as well as the mitophagy factor Parkin. This leads to decreased mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy, which can further exacerbate the mitochondrial dysfunction caused by the redox imbalance.

In conclusion, nanomicelle curcumin-induced testicular toxicity is likely due to its ability to induce oxidative stress and redox imbalance, as well as its ability to alter mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy. These effects can lead to decreased spermatogenesis, decreased sperm motility, and increased testicular apoptosis. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying nanomicelle curcumin-induced testicular toxicity and its potential implications for human health.",1
"This meta-analysis was conducted to assess the average slow fiber content of skeletal muscle across mammalian species. The data was collected from 2023 studies, which included data from a variety of mammalian species. The average slow fiber content was found to be 33.2% across all species. This result was consistent across all species, regardless of size or type. The range of slow fiber content across species was found to be between 25.2% and 41.3%. These results indicate that slow fiber content is relatively consistent across mammalian species, with the majority of species having an average slow fiber content of 33.2%.",1

"The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that the vaccine was 97.4% effective in preventing cervical, vulvar, and vaginal pre-cancers caused by the nine HPV strains. The vaccine was also found to be 97.4% effective in preventing genital warts.

The trial involved over 14,000 women aged 16 to 26 and followed them for an average of 8.5 years. The study found that the vaccine was effective in protecting against pre-cancers caused by HPV types 16 and 18, the two strains that are responsible for 70% of cervical cancers. The vaccine was also found to be effective in protecting against pre-cancers caused by HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, which are responsible for an additional 20% of cervical cancers.

The study has implications for public health, as it demonstrates the long-term effectiveness of the HPV vaccine in preventing pre-cancers caused by multiple HPV strains. It also highlights the importance of vaccinating girls and women of all ages, as the vaccine is most effective when given before exposure to the virus. The findings underscore the need for global access to the HPV vaccine, as cervical cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death among women in many low- and middle-income countries.",1

"This type of inference is a way of combining prior knowledge with new data to refine and update beliefs. It is the same process used by scientists to determine the likelihood of a certain event or outcome.

Bayesian inference allows the brain to update its beliefs in light of new evidence. In this way, the brain can rapidly adapt to changes in the environment and make more accurate predictions. This process is believed to be a key factor in the brain's ability to learn and adapt to new situations. It is also thought to be an important factor in the development of higher cognitive functions such as decision-making and problem-solving.",1
"The concept of an “inverse vaccine” has been gaining traction in recent years as a potential treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS) and other autoimmune diseases. The idea behind an inverse vaccine is to use a virus or other agent to stimulate the body’s immune system to produce antibodies that can target and destroy the cells causing the autoimmune disease. This approach is different from traditional vaccines, which are designed to protect against disease by stimulating the body’s immune system to produce antibodies that can recognize and destroy foreign pathogenic invaders.

Inverse vaccines have been studied in preclinical models of MS and other autoimmune diseases, and the results have been promising. In one study, researchers used an inverse vaccine to induce protective immunity in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of MS. The vaccine successfully reduced the severity of the disease symptoms and protected the mice from developing more severe disease.

In addition, researchers have also conducted clinical trials with an inverse vaccine for MS. The results of these trials have been promising, showing that the vaccine was safe and well tolerated, and that it had a beneficial effect on disease symptoms. However, further research is needed before an inverse vaccine can be approved for clinical use.

Overall, the concept of an inverse vaccine is promising, and it could potentially provide an effective treatment for MS and other autoimmune diseases.",1

"AI models are still limited in their ability to understand the nuances of language and context. They can be fooled by sentences that are nonsensical or contain words that are not in their vocabulary. Humans, on the other hand, can usually determine the meaning of a sentence, even if it contains unfamiliar words or is structured in an unfamiliar way. This is because humans are able to draw on their experiences and knowledge to infer the meaning of the sentence. AI models are not yet able to draw on this kind of contextual information, which is why they can be fooled by nonsensical sentences.",1
Citizen science has been used to reveal landscape-scale exposures to multiazole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus bioaerosols. Citizen scientists collected air samples from different locations across the United States and used quantitative PCR to identify the presence of multiazole-resistant A. fumigatus bioaerosols. The results indicated that these bioaerosols were present in both indoor and outdoor locations and that their presence was more prevalent in urban areas than rural ones. These findings suggest that there is a need for increased awareness and action to reduce the spread of multiazole-resistant bioaerosols and their associated health risks.,1
"The analysis shows that although this paradigm has led to the development of a number of life-saving drugs, it has been inefficient in terms of its success rate, cost, and time to market. The authors suggest that alternative paradigms such as phenotypic drug discovery, systems biology, and network pharmacology should be explored to improve the efficiency of drug discovery. This paper provides a valuable insight into the current state of drug discovery and highlights the need for alternative approaches.",1

The study, published in the journal Sleep, was conducted by a team of researchers from the University of California, Berkeley. It involved 36 healthy adults, aged 18 to 29, who were split into two groups. The first group was tasked with staying up for an entire night, while the second group was allowed to sleep for eight hours.

Both groups were then asked to complete a series of computer-based tests of attention and alertness. While the group that had stayed up all night performed significantly worse than the well-rested group, the study found that those who had taken two nap sessions — a 90-min one followed by a quick 30-min shut-eye later — showed fewer signs of fatigue and drowsiness than those who had taken a single 120-min nap.

The researchers concluded that, when facing a night of sleep deprivation, two shorter naps are more effective at helping to keep alertness levels up than a single longer nap.",1
"This research provides evidence that bullying victimization is associated with an increased likelihood of bringing a weapon to school. It suggests that interventions to reduce bullying victimization may help to reduce the prevalence of weapons in schools. Additionally, the research indicates that interventions to reduce bullying victimization should include strategies to increase feelings of safety in school, promote positive future education orientations, and reduce the amount of school skipping. These findings are important for informing school policies and practices to reduce the prevalence of weapons in schools.",1
"When people experience scarcity, they are more likely to focus on short-term needs and solutions, such as finding ways to pay for food or shelter. This can lead to decisions that prioritize immediate benefits over long-term gains, such as taking out a loan with high interest rates or not saving for retirement.

However, research has shown that people living in poverty usually make the same decisions as those who are not living in poverty, when given the same options. This suggests that people make reasonable decisions in the face of scarcity, and that their decisions are often driven by the need to survive and provide for their families.

In addition, research has shown that people living in poverty are often able to think long-term and take steps to improve their future economic security. For example, people in poverty are more likely to use financial products such as savings accounts or insurance. This suggests that people living in poverty are often able to think about the future, even in the face of scarcity.

Overall, research suggests that people living in poverty are not short-sighted or irrational when it comes to making decisions. Rather, people make reasonable decisions in the face of scarcity, and often prioritize short-term needs over long-term gains in order to survive and provide for their families.",1
"The microorganism—a species of Pseudomonas bacteria—was engineered to produce an enzyme called PETase, which can break down PET into its building blocks, monomers. By breaking down the plastic, the bacteria can use the monomers as a source of energy.

This breakthrough could have significant implications for reducing plastic pollution in the ocean. The bacteria could be used to degrade plastic in coastal areas, rivers, and other bodies of water, preventing plastic from entering the ocean and damaging marine ecosystems. Additionally, the bacteria could be used to break down plastic that is already in the ocean, reducing the amount of microplastics in the water. Furthermore, the monomers produced by the bacteria could be used as a source of energy, potentially providing a sustainable source of fuel.",1

". Aluminum is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant with potential neurotoxic effects. Previous studies have shown that aluminum exposure can induce neurotoxicity in various models. However, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we found that aluminum exposure induced central nervous system (CNS) impairment in a mouse model. Further investigation showed that aluminum exposure upregulated NLRP3 inflammasome expression and induced pyroptosis in the CNS of mice. Moreover, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome protected mice from aluminum-induced CNS impairment. These results suggest that aluminum exposure induces CNS impairment via activating NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis pathway. Our findings provide a new insight into the neurotoxicity of aluminum and may help to develop effective strategies for preventing aluminum-induced CNS impairment.",1

The study, published in the journal Circulation, found that women who maintained or increased their physical activity levels from ages 20 to 40 had a lower risk of developing high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes in their mid-40s. The study also found that women who reported higher levels of physical activity in their 20s had lower levels of triglycerides, a type of fat in the blood, in their mid-40s.

The researchers analyzed survey data from 479 women who reported their physical activity levels every three years from age 20 to mid-40s. The women were asked to rate their activity levels on a scale from one to five, with five being the most active.

The results showed that women who maintained or increased their physical activity levels over the 20-year period had a lower risk of developing high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes in their mid-40s. Additionally, the study found that women who reported higher levels of physical activity in their 20s had lower levels of triglycerides in their mid-40s.

The findings suggest that women can benefit from maintaining or increasing physical activity levels throughout their 20s and 30s, leading to better heart health later in life. The results also indicate that physical activity in the 20s and 30s may have a protective effect against the development of certain cardiovascular risk factors.

With this data, the machine learning algorithm can accurately detect signs of impairment due to alcohol consumption.

The technology has the potential to be used as a tool for early detection of alcohol-related impairments and to help inform decisions on when it is safe to drive or perform other tasks. It could also be used to provide feedback to people about their alcohol consumption, allowing them to make more informed decisions about the amount of alcohol they consume.",1
"Domestic cats (Felis catus) are obligate carnivores, meaning they must consume meat to meet their dietary requirements. This diet consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals, as well as other compounds such as amino acids and nucleotides. One of these compounds is glutamate, which is responsible for the umami taste. It is believed that cats are able to detect and respond to umami taste, but very little research has been conducted on their umami taste perception and preferences.

The few studies that have been conducted suggest that cats may be able to perceive umami taste, and that they prefer the taste of umami-rich foods. For example, cats prefer to eat foods containing monosodium glutamate (MSG) compared to foods without it. Additionally, cats have been found to prefer foods with higher concentrations of free glutamate compared to foods with lower concentrations. This suggests that cats may be able to detect and respond to the umami taste of glutamate.

Overall, the research suggests that cats may be able to perceive and prefer umami taste, although more research is needed to confirm this. Additionally, more research is needed to understand how cats respond to different concentrations of umami-rich compounds and how this may affect their dietary preferences.",1

"The study, published in the journal Injury Epidemiology, found that those who acquired firearms during the pandemic had higher rates of recent suicidal thoughts (13.3%), self-harm behaviors (6.1%), and intimate partner violence (2.7%) compared to those who did not acquire firearms (4.4%, 0.5%, and 0.6%, respectively).

The study also found that those who acquired firearms during the pandemic were more likely to be male, younger, and white compared to those who did not acquire firearms. They were also more likely to report mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder.

The authors of the study suggest that the higher rates of mental health problems and recent suicidal thoughts among those who acquired firearms during the pandemic could be explained by the “acute stressors” associated with the pandemic, such as job and financial insecurity, loneliness, and fear of the virus.

They also point out that access to firearms during a period of heightened stress could increase the risk of suicide or other self-harm behaviors. The authors suggest that health care providers, firearm retailers, and public health officials should be aware of the potential risks of firearm acquisition during the pandemic and should consider strategies to reduce access to firearms among those at risk for suicide or other self-harm behaviors.",1
"The free-energy principle (FEP) has been proposed as a unifying framework for understanding the brain's ability to self-organize and learn. This theory has been extensively studied in theoretical and computational models, but its predictions have not yet been tested in real neurons. Here, we present an experimental validation of the FEP in an in vitro neural network. We show that the network can self-organize and learn to recognize patterns without any external supervision, in agreement with the FEP's predictions. In addition, we demonstrate that the network can learn to recognize patterns with different levels of complexity, depending on the network's architecture, and that this learning is mediated by changes in synaptic strength. Our results provide the first experimental evidence for the FEP in real neurons and suggest that self-organized learning is possible in neural networks.",1

"of rivers. This is compared to the ocean, where warming was observed in only 60% of ocean regions and oxygen loss was observed in only 10% of ocean regions.

The study suggests that this is due to the fact that rivers are more shallow and have less area to absorb heat than oceans, and that the additional nutrients found in rivers can lead to increased oxygen depletion. Additionally, the study found that rivers are warming faster than oceans, with a rate of 0.25 degrees Celsius per decade compared to 0.14 degrees Celsius per decade in the ocean.

The study highlights the need to better understand and protect the world’s rivers, which are essential to the health of the planet’s ecosystems and the human populations that rely on them.

"The presence of mature bull sharks in a golf course lake in Australia has raised concerns about the species’ ability to thrive in freshwater environments. The bull sharks were first detected in the lake in 2011 following major flooding that allowed the sharks to move upstream from the ocean. Scientists believe the sharks were able to reach maturity due to the abundance of food sources in the lake, such as small fish, frogs, and even birds.

The presence of these sharks has sparked debate about the potential risks they pose to recreational lake users. While bull sharks are known to be aggressive when provoked, there have been no reported incidents of attacks in the Australian lake. However, it is important for lake users to be aware of their presence and to take necessary precautions.

The presence of bull sharks in freshwater environments is not uncommon, as the species has been found in rivers and lakes around the world, including the Amazon River and Lake Nicaragua. This discovery highlights the species’ remarkable ability to adapt to different environments and serves as a reminder that even in the most unexpected places, wildlife can still thrive.",1

"The study, which was published in the journal Nature Sustainability, was conducted by researchers at the University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory. They looked at the potential benefits of replacing 30% of all on-road combustion-engine vehicles in the Chicago region with electric vehicles (EVs).

The researchers found that replacing 30% of all on-road combustion-engine vehicles with EVs would reduce fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions by 26%, nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions by 33% and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 20%. This would lead to an estimated 1,000 fewer premature deaths annually as a result of reduced air pollution exposure.

The researchers also estimated that the Chicago region would save over $10 billion a year in healthcare costs, fuel costs, and car maintenance costs due to the switch to EVs. The savings would be due to lower air pollution-related healthcare costs, lower fuel costs, and reduced maintenance costs for EVs compared to combustion-engine vehicles.

"The study, led by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), is the first to track individual electrons from tritium beta decay with high precision. This method uses a technique called the “cyclotron radiation emission spectroscopy” (CRES) to measure the energy of the electrons emitted from the decay of tritium atoms. By measuring the energy of the electrons, the researchers were able to accurately calculate the neutrino mass.

The team’s findings, published in the journal Nature, are a major step forward in neutrino mass measurements and could help scientists better understand the nature of these mysterious particles.

The method uses a unique combination of CRES and an advanced detector to measure the energy of the electrons with high precision. This allows researchers to accurately determine the neutrino mass, which is an important parameter in the Standard Model of particle physics.

The team’s findings also provide an important benchmark for future experiments that aim to measure the mass of the neutrino. This is critical for understanding the properties of the universe and could have implications for theories beyond the Standard Model.

"The birds make their instruments from available materials, such as sticks, seedpods, and nuts. The cockatoos select these materials based on their size, shape, and weight, as well as the sound they produce when struck against a hard surface. The birds then use their beaks to carve away parts of the material to create a handle or a head. By selecting materials and carving them into the desired shape, the cockatoos craft their instruments to achieve the sound they prefer. 

The musical displays of the palm cockatoos are thought to be important for mating success. The birds use their drumsticks to create a complex rhythm and melody that can be heard up to a kilometer away. The female palm cockatoos have been observed listening to the male's performance and responding by displaying a mating dance. The drumming displays are also thought to be a way for the palm cockatoos to maintain their social bonds. The birds have been seen drumming together, which likely serves to strengthen their relationships.

"Autonomous racing is an exciting and challenging field of robotics and artificial intelligence. It involves the use of advanced techniques such as optimal control and reinforcement learning to enable vehicles to navigate a race course autonomously. Optimal control is a powerful tool for designing control systems that can follow a predetermined path and reach a desired goal. On the other hand, reinforcement learning is a technique that allows machines to learn from their environment and to develop strategies for navigating a race track without relying on predefined parameters. While both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, they both offer the potential to reach the limit in autonomous racing.

Optimal control is a powerful tool for autonomous racing because it can provide a precise and efficient solution for a given problem. It can also be used to design control systems that can take into account the specific dynamics of the environment and the vehicle, allowing it to better adapt to changing conditions and reach a desired goal. However, optimal control requires a precise model of the environment and vehicle and can be computationally expensive.

Reinforcement learning is an alternative approach to autonomous racing that can learn from its environment and develop strategies for navigating a race track without relying on predefined parameters. It can be used to develop control systems that can adjust to changing conditions and reach a desired goal. Although reinforcement learning is less precise than optimal control, it is faster and does not require a precise model of the environment and vehicle.

In conclusion, both optimal control and reinforcement learning have their own advantages and disadvantages. Optimal control is a powerful tool for designing control systems that can precisely follow a predetermined path and reach a desired goal, but it is computationally expensive and requires a precise model of the environment and vehicle. On the other hand, reinforcement learning is less precise but faster and can be used to develop control systems that can adjust to changing conditions and reach a desired goal without relying on predefined parameters. Ultimately, the choice between these two approaches should be based on the specific requirements of the application and the available resources.",1
". This includes activities such as sitting at a desk, watching television, or using a computer.

Studies have shown that long periods of sedentary behavior can increase the risk of developing dementia by up to 20%. This is thought to be due to the lack of physical activity and potential cognitive decline associated with being sedentary for extended periods of time. Prolonged periods of sitting can also lead to other health problems such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, which are all associated with an increased risk of dementia.

In order to reduce the risk of dementia, it is important to limit time spent engaging in sedentary activities and incorporate more physical activity into daily life. This could include taking frequent breaks from sitting to walk around, stretching, or doing some light exercise. Additionally, engaging in activities that stimulate the mind, such as reading, playing games, or engaging in social activities, can help to reduce the risk of developing dementia.",1

"A new study of data from over 150,000 women has found that being breastfed in infancy significantly increased the risk of colorectal cancer and precursor lesions in adults. The study, published in the International Journal of Cancer, found that those who were breastfed had a 24% higher risk of colorectal cancer and a 33% higher risk of precursor lesions compared to those who were not breastfed.

The researchers used data from the Nurses' Health Study II, which has followed more than 150,000 female nurses since 1989. They looked at the participants' reported breastfeeding history and their risk of colorectal cancer and its precursor lesions, known as adenomas.

The researchers found that the longer a woman was breastfed, the higher her risk of colorectal cancer and adenomas. Women who reported being breastfed for at least 12 months were 24% more likely to develop colorectal cancer and 33% more likely to develop adenomas, compared to those who were never breastfed.

The researchers also looked at the effect of breastfeeding on other types of cancer, but did not find any significant associations.

The authors point out that their findings should be interpreted with caution, as the study was observational and could not prove a causal relationship between breastfeeding and colorectal cancer. They suggest that further research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind the association.

The authors concluded, ""Our study suggests that breastfeeding may be associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer and adenomas in adulthood. Further research is needed to understand the biological mechanisms underlying this association.""",1
"Vitamin B6 is an essential nutrient involved in many metabolic processes. During growth, the local compartmentalization of metabolic enzymes affects the availability of vitamin B6, as well as how it is metabolized. Enzymes involved in the metabolism of vitamin B6 need to be localized to the appropriate cellular compartments for optimal activity. This compartmentalization is determined by several factors, including the concentration of enzymes, the presence of other nutrients, and the availability of cofactors. Additionally, the presence of genetic and epigenetic variations can affect the compartmentalization of enzymes. Thus, the local compartmentalization of metabolic enzymes during growth can have a significant impact on the availability and metabolism of vitamin B6.",1

Finally, the data could be used to identify genetic variants that may be associated with diabetes-related complications, such as cardiovascular disease and stroke.",1
". These neighborhoods included South Atlanta, East Atlanta, and West End. The influx of investors in these neighborhoods drove up prices and made it difficult for families who had been living in these areas for generations to purchase homes. This has had a significant impact on the communities as many of the homes are now rental properties, and the character of the neighborhoods has changed. This phenomenon is not unique to Atlanta; similar trends have been seen in other cities across the country.",1
"The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, found that TUS can produce significant changes in brain function. The study used TUS to target specific areas of the brain and measure its effect on cognitive performance. The results showed that TUS had a significant effect on cognitive performance, with participants performing better on tasks after undergoing TUS. The study also found that the effects of TUS were longer-lasting, with participants showing improved performance for up to two weeks after the stimulation.

The study also examined the safety of TUS, finding that it was generally well-tolerated and had no significant adverse effects. In addition, the study found that the effects of TUS could be reversed by removing the stimulation.

The results of the study suggest that TUS may be a useful tool for enhancing cognitive performance in healthy individuals, as well as for treating neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, further research is needed to fully understand the potential of this emerging technique.",1
"The studies, conducted by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard University, and the University of California, Berkeley, found that people tend to focus on their best-case scenario when making predictions about future events, and largely ignore their worst-case scenario. This tendency, which the researchers refer to as “optimistic bias,” was observed in a variety of contexts, from predicting how long a project will take to complete to forecasting the outcome of a job interview.

The researchers surveyed 2,900 American adults and asked them to make predictions about a variety of future events. Across all scenarios, the participants tended to focus on their best-case scenario and largely ignore their worst-case scenario. The researchers also found that the participants’ predictions were “realistic” in the sense that they were generally accurate compared to the actual outcomes.

The findings suggest that people are naturally inclined to focus on the positive when making predictions about the future. This tendency may be beneficial in certain contexts, as it increases optimism and motivation. However, it may also lead to inaccurate predictions and result in undesirable outcomes.",1
"would need to take into account the physiological, cognitive, and behavioral aspects of the disorder. On the physiological level, the model would need to take into account the auditory processing of the sound, the physiological response of the body to the sound, and the autonomic nervous system response to the sound. On the cognitive level, the model would need to take into account how the individual perceives the sound, how the individual evaluates the sound, and how the individual interprets the sound. Finally, on the behavioral level, the model would need to take into account how the individual responds to the sound, including any avoidance behaviors or coping strategies that may be employed. It is important to note that the model would need to account for any interplay between these three aspects of the disorder, as the physiological, cognitive, and behavioral aspects of misophonia are all intertwined.",1

"Working memory is a cognitive ability that allows us to store and process information in short-term memory. It is an important component of many cognitive processes, such as decision-making, problem-solving, and language comprehension. Visual working memory is a special form of working memory that is used to store and process visual information. It is essential for tasks such as object recognition and scene understanding. Recent research has shown that learning-induced plasticity can enhance the capacity of visual working memory. This means that with practice, individuals can increase their ability to store and process visual information in working memory. For example, studies have found that playing video games or using computer-based training programs can lead to increases in working memory capacity. Other research has found that learning a new language or learning to juggle can also lead to increases in visual working memory capacity. These findings suggest that learning-induced plasticity can be a powerful tool for enhancing visual working memory capacity.",1

The large-scale study from three Nordic countries included nearly 300,000 people with reflux disease and followed them over a period of 15 years. The results showed that the cancer risk for patients with reflux disease was not significantly higher than for the general population. The only exception was for those patients who had undergone gastroscopy and had changes in the oesophageal mucosa. In this group, the risk of developing cancer was significantly higher.

The results of the study suggest that most patients with reflux disease do not face an increased cancer risk. However, it is important to remember that the risk is still elevated for those with changes in the oesophageal mucosa, and they should be monitored closely for any signs of cancer.",1
"Research conducted by linguists at the University of Georgia has found that the classic Southern accent is fading away quickly in the United States. The study analyzed the speech of over 1,000 people from 16 states across the South, and found that the Southern drawl is disappearing faster than many other regional accents in the country. The study found that younger generations are less likely to use the Southern accent, as they are exposed to a wider variety of language influences. Additionally, the study showed that the Southern accent was more likely to be used in rural areas, and that it was becoming less common in urban areas. The study concluded that the classic Southern accent is slowly being replaced by a more neutral American accent.",1
"The model developed by researchers at Harvard Medical School and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology uses machine learning to analyze the shape, size, and chemical properties of two proteins and predict how strongly they will bind. By understanding how proteins interact with each other, scientists can design drugs that target specific proteins, as well as understand how to modify existing drugs to make them more effective.

The model was trained using over 1,000 protein-protein interactions and tested on a separate set of interactions. It was able to accurately predict the strength of the bond between the proteins with an accuracy of more than 90 percent. The model also revealed insights into the key features that make a strong protein-protein interaction, such as the size of the proteins and the presence of positively or negatively charged amino acids.

The model can help scientists design drugs that target specific proteins more effectively, as well as understand how to modify existing drugs to make them more effective. It could also be used to create more accurate computer simulations of protein-protein interactions, which can help researchers better understand how drugs interact with proteins in the body.",1
"Perceptual awareness is the ability to accurately perceive and interpret sensory information. It is an important cognitive function, as it allows us to make sense of the world around us. In recent years, research has suggested that perceptual awareness occurs along a graded continuum, rather than as an all-or-none failure in continuous reproduction tasks. This means that some people may have greater perceptual awareness than others, but even those with lower levels of awareness can still accurately perceive and interpret sensory information.

One example of research that supports this idea is a study conducted by Van Engen, Kessels, and Böcker (2013). In this study, participants were asked to reproduce shapes that were presented to them. The shapes were presented in a continuous sequence, with the shapes appearing one after the other. Results showed that participants’ ability to accurately reproduce the shapes increased with each shape they reproduced, suggesting that perceptual awareness occurs along a graded continuum.

Other studies have also provided evidence that perceptual awareness occurs along a graded continuum. For example, a study by Böcker et al. (2014) asked participants to reproduce shapes that were presented to them in a continuous sequence. Results showed that participants’ ability to accurately reproduce the shapes increased with each shape they reproduced, suggesting that perceptual awareness occurs along a graded continuum.

Overall, the evidence suggests that perceptual awareness occurs along a graded continuum, rather than as an all-or-none failure in continuous reproduction tasks. This means that some people may have greater perceptual awareness than others, but even those with lower levels of awareness can still accurately perceive and interpret sensory information.",1
"A recent study conducted by researchers from the University of Jyväskylä in Finland has found that resistance exercise training is linked to reduced depressive symptoms in young adults.

Lead poisoning is caused by the exposure to lead, a toxic metal found in air, soil, and water. Lead can be found in lead-based paint, dust, soil, drinking water, and consumer products. Lead poisoning can cause a variety of health problems, including learning disabilities, behavioral problems, hearing loss, seizures, and even death in extreme cases. It is particularly dangerous for young children, as their developing brains and bodies are more susceptible to the effects of lead.

Lead exposure is linked to a number of health problems, including cardiovascular and kidney diseases, as well as an increased risk of developing certain types of cancer. It can also cause developmental delays in children, leading to lower IQ scores, learning disabilities, and difficulty concentrating.

Lead poisoning can be prevented by avoiding exposure to lead-containing products, such as lead-based paint and leaded gasoline, as well as testing for lead in water and soil. Additionally, children should be tested for lead levels if they may be exposed to lead, such as those living in older homes. If lead levels are found to be too high, steps should be taken to reduce exposure and eliminate the source of lead.",1

"The researchers used a combination of biochemical and biophysical methods to analyze the changes in the structure of proteins in aged cells. They observed that proteins in aged cells had altered patterns of folding, which could lead to reduced function. The team also identified specific proteins that were more prone to structural changes, which could be used as potential biomarkers for aging.

The study suggests that understanding the structural changes in proteins could help develop therapies to slow or reverse the aging process. The findings could also help develop new strategies for treating age-related diseases. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of the findings and how they can be applied to develop new treatments.",1
"The new species, named Paralititan stromeri, is one of the largest land animals ever discovered, measuring up to 40 meters in length and weighing up to 80 tons. It is the first titanosaur discovered in Africa and is believed to have lived during the late Cretaceous period, approximately 100 million years ago.

The discovery of Paralititan stromeri was made by an international team of paleontologists led by Dr. Joshua Smith of the University of Pennsylvania. The team uncovered a partial skeleton of the new species in the Quseir Formation, which is an area of desert in Egypt renowned for its fossil discoveries.

The discovery of Paralititan stromeri provides valuable insights into the evolution of sauropod dinosaurs and helps to fill in some of the gaps in our knowledge of dinosaur diversity in the late Cretaceous period.",1
"The study, published in Nature Food, outlines a strategy for reducing emissions from agriculture and land use by 2050, while still providing enough food for a growing global population.

The researchers suggest that substituting 50% of consumed animal products with plant-based alternatives could lead to a 31% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and land use, compared to current trends. This would result in a total reduction of 17.4 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.

The researchers also found that this substitution could lead to a reduction in land use of 10%, and a reduction in water use of 15%. In addition, the model predicts that the global demand for agricultural land could be reduced by 1.6 billion hectares.

The researchers suggest that this strategy could be achieved through a combination of dietary changes, technological advances, and policy changes. They suggest that dietary changes could be achieved through public education and promotion of plant-based alternatives, technological advances could enable more efficient production of plant-based proteins, and policy changes could incentivize the adoption of more sustainable agricultural practices.

The authors of the study acknowledge that these changes will not be easy to implement, and will require a significant investment of resources and political will. However, they argue that the potential benefits of such a strategy make it worth pursuing.",1
"The research, published in the journal Earth System Dynamics, looked at the impacts of drought across the United States and found that current indicators, such as the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), were not always accurate. The study found that the PDSI does not accurately reflect the severity of drought in certain regions, such as the Southwest and California, where high temperatures and low precipitation can contribute to severe drought conditions. The researchers suggest that more localized drought indicators, such as the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), may be more effective in predicting drought conditions in these regions. The findings could help improve planning and response to drought events in the future.",1
"A new study published in Nature Communications has found that climate change is breaking down the communication networks that exist between fungi and trees. The research found that rising temperatures are disrupting the way that trees and fungi interact, which could have negative impacts on the health and growth of trees.

The study used an experimental setup to measure the communication networks between trees and fungi in a controlled environment. Researchers found that higher temperatures caused a breakdown in the communication networks, which led to decreased growth and health in the trees. This suggests that climate change is having an impact on the way that trees and fungi interact, which could have a negative effect on the health of forests around the world.

The findings of the study are concerning, as fungi are essential for the health of trees and forest ecosystems. Trees rely on fungi for essential nutrients and minerals, and fungi play an important role in the decomposition of dead organic matter. If the communication networks between trees and fungi are disrupted, it could lead to decreased health and growth in trees, which could have a devastating impact on the health of forests.

The study highlights the need for more research into the effects of climate change on tree-fungi communication networks, and the potential impacts that this could have on the health of forests. It also highlights the need for policies and strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on forests and the organisms that inhabit them.",1

"The physics of saltwater taffy involves the presence of air bubbles, oil droplets and emulsifiers. These components contribute to the texture, chewiness and flavor of the taffy. 

Air bubbles are created when the taffy is whipped, allowing air to be incorporated into the mixture. This helps to lighten the texture, making it easier to pull and stretch. 

Oil droplets help to create a smooth texture and add flavor. Emulsifiers are added to help the oil droplets disperse evenly throughout the mixture and help to create a chewier texture. 

The sugar content of the taffy also contributes to its texture. As the taffy cools and sets, the sugar molecules form a network that helps hold the taffy together. This also makes it easier to pull and stretch. 

Finally, the salt content of the taffy helps to enhance the flavor and helps to bind the other ingredients together. 

Overall, a combination of air bubbles, oil droplets, emulsifiers, sugar and salt help to create the unique texture and flavor of saltwater taffy.",1

Specifically, cats fed vegan cat food had similar rates of overall health, average weight, average lifespan, and incidence of common illnesses such as urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal issues, and skin disorders, compared to cats fed meat-based cat food. These findings suggest that vegan cat food can provide cats with adequate nutrition and health outcomes, and that it is a viable alternative to meat-based cat food.",1
"The research was conducted by a team of scientists from the Tokyo Institute of Technology, and was published in the journal Nature Communications. The team used a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) to directly convert methylcyclohexane into electricity. This is the first time electricity has been generated directly from an organic hydride.

The SOFC was able to convert the energy from the organic hydride into electricity with an energy efficiency of around 10%, which is lower than the energy efficiency of conventional catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. However, this is still a significant achievement, as organic hydrides are typically difficult to convert into electricity.

The researchers hope that this research could lead to the development of more efficient and cost-effective ways of producing electricity from organic hydrides. This could be a significant breakthrough in the field of renewable energy, as organic hydrides are abundant in nature and could be used to generate electricity in a more sustainable way.",1
"Background: Toothbrush contamination has been a neglected area of oral health research. Studies from the past two decades have identified an array of microbial organisms, including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa, in toothbrushes that can cause oral health problems. This review seeks to update the literature on toothbrush contamination, including the types of microorganisms found, the sources of contamination, and the methods used to reduce contamination.

Methods: A systematic search of six databases was conducted to identify relevant studies published from January 2000 to September 2023. Studies were included if they reported on microbial contamination of toothbrushes used by the general population.

Results: A total of 43 studies were included in the review. The most commonly detected microorganism was Streptococcus, followed by Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. The main sources of contamination were saliva, tap water, and toothpaste. The most commonly used methods for reducing contamination were brushing with a new toothbrush, rinsing with antibacterial mouthwash, and soaking in hydrogen peroxide.

Conclusion: This review highlights the need for further research to understand toothbrush contamination and appropriate methods to reduce it. The findings suggest that the general population should take measures to reduce microbial contamination of their toothbrush, such as using a new toothbrush, rinsing with antibacterial mouthwash, and soaking in hydrogen peroxide.",1

"The study, published in the journal Animals, surveyed 563 people who adopted a dog from a shelter in the Netherlands. The survey asked about their perceptions of the pet’s behavior, how it was responding to training, how satisfied the owners were with the pet, and more.

In general, the survey found that owners were very satisfied with their new pet, with the majority reporting they were extremely satisfied or satisfied.

However, the study also found that the adjustment period for a new shelter dog was longer than expected. On average, it took about 6 months for the pet to settle in and become accustomed to its new home and routine. During that time, owners reported that their pet was displaying a variety of problem behaviors, including chewing, barking, and being overly excitable.

The study also found that owners often had to work hard to help their new pet adjust. This included providing consistent and positive reinforcement, as well as making sure the pet was getting enough exercise and mental stimulation.

Overall, the study found that while the adjustment period for a new shelter dog may be longer than expected, owners can be highly satisfied with their new pet if they are willing to put in the effort to help it settle in.",1

The study, conducted by researchers at Stanford University and Cornell University, surveyed 1,000 people from the US and Canada about their feelings towards receiving messages from friends that were written with assistance from either AI or another person.

The results showed that people were more likely to be dissatisfied with messages that were written with AI assistance than those written with help from another person. People found AI-assisted messages to be less personal, less meaningful, and less sincere. They also felt that messages written with AI assistance were less likely to reflect the sender’s true feelings.

The study's authors suggest that people may be more likely to be dissatisfied with AI-assisted messages because they don't believe AI can accurately capture the nuances of human communication. They also suggest that the lack of a human connection between the sender and the AI may make messages feel less meaningful.

Overall, the study provides evidence that people are not comfortable with the idea of AI-assisted messages, and that they prefer messages written with help from another person. Moving forward, it will be important for AI developers to consider how their technology is being used, and to ensure that AI-assisted messages are crafted in a way that maintains a human connection and authenticity.",1

It is also urging countries to monitor their own borders for the presence of the ants and to report any new infestations to the European Commission.",1
"Researchers at Oxford University studied a population of jackdaws in the university's Wytham Woods. They found the jackdaws actively switch their social connections to gain access to food, but when it comes to relationships with family members, they are more loyal.

The team observed how the jackdaws interacted with each other when food was scarce and when food was abundant. When food was scarce, the jackdaws tended to stick with family members, even when they had the opportunity to switch to a more profitable relationship with a non-family member.

However, when food was abundant, the jackdaws were more likely to switch their social connections to gain access to the food. The researchers believe that this behavior is a way for the jackdaws to maximize their food resources.

The researchers said that the jackdaws' behavior is similar to the proverb “blood is thicker than water”, which expresses the idea that family ties are stronger than other relationships.

The results suggest that jackdaws are able to adjust their social networks in order to gain access to food, while at the same time maintaining loyalty to their family members. The findings could have implications for understanding the evolution of sociality in animals, including humans.",1

The study, conducted by researchers from the University of Michigan and published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, found that exposure to natural environments consistently improved visuospatial working memory performance in participants.

The study used a computer-based task to measure participants’ visuospatial working memory performance. Participants completed the task while viewing images of natural environments (e.g., forests, beaches, and mountains) or urban environments (e.g., buildings, roads, and bridges).

The results showed that participants who viewed natural environments performed significantly better on the task than those who viewed urban environments. The researchers concluded that exposure to natural environments can improve visuospatial working memory performance, suggesting that exposure to natural environments may be beneficial for cognitive functioning.

These findings are important because they suggest that exposure to natural environments may be beneficial for cognitive functioning, and could potentially be used as a tool for improving cognitive performance. However, more research is needed to examine the long-term effects of exposure to natural environments on cognitive performance.",1
"Nano droplets made of a germanium and platinum mixture can be made to ""go skiing"" at high temperatures by using a technique called levitated dipole oscillation (LDO). This technique uses a laser to heat the droplet, which is then levitated in a vacuum chamber. As the droplet is heated, it experiences a force from the laser that causes it to oscillate in a circular pattern. The oscillations cause the droplet to move around the chamber in a skiing-like motion, which can be observed with a microscope.",1
"The researchers, from the University of Queensland, used genomic sequencing to investigate the genetic makeup of the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, commonly known as Golden staph. The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, identified two genes known to confer antibiotic resistance. The genes are called mecA and mecC, and they encode enzymes that can modify antibiotics and make them ineffective against the bacteria. The researchers also found that the mecA gene was more commonly found in multi-drug-resistant strains of Golden staph, suggesting that this gene plays a major role in the bacteria’s ability to survive in the presence of antibiotics. The findings could help in the development of new treatments to combat antibiotic-resistant infections.",1
". The study, published in the journal Science Immunology, found that chitin triggers an immune response that works to reduce the body’s capacity to store fat. 

The study was conducted by scientists at the University of Iowa and the National Institutes of Health. The researchers used mice to analyze the effects of chitin ingestion on the body’s immune system. The mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with chitin. The researchers found that the mice fed the chitin-enriched diet had significantly lower body fat, lower levels of inflammation, and increased expression of certain immune genes that are associated with anti-obesity effects. 

The study also found that the mice that ate the chitin-enriched diet showed improved insulin sensitivity and increased levels of beneficial bacteria in their gut. The researchers suggest that the effects of chitin on the immune system may be linked to its ability to stimulate the production of anti-inflammatory molecules and its ability to modulate the composition of the gut microbiome. 

The findings of this study suggest that chitin may be a useful dietary supplement for individuals looking to reduce their risk of obesity and improve their overall health. Further research is needed to determine if the effects of chitin on the immune system observed in mice are also present in humans.",1

The researchers suggest that more rigorous methods of content evaluation be developed to ensure that readers are not fooled by AI-generated content.",1
"A recent study published in the journal Nature Climate Change found that fish stocks along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the United States were largely unaffected by marine heat waves. The study, which used data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), found that while some species may have been temporarily impacted, overall the fish stocks remained stable. The study concluded that while climate change could ultimately have impacts on fish stocks, the current level of marine heat waves have not had a major impact.",1
"These include the ""ideal body"" type, the ""athletic body"" type, the ""curvy body"" type, and the ""unhealthy body"" type. Each of these body types can benefit from different types of exercise.

For the ""ideal body"" type, a combination of aerobic and strength training is recommended. This should focus on toning and strengthening the body, while avoiding bulking up. Cardio exercises such as running and swimming are ideal for this body type, as they will help to burn calories and improve overall fitness. Strength training should focus on exercises that target the core, arms, and legs, as these areas are key to achieving an ideal body shape.

The ""athletic body"" type should focus on strength training that targets all major muscle groups. This should be done in combination with regular aerobic exercise, as it will help to improve endurance and help to prevent injury. Exercises such as squats, deadlifts, and lunges should be included in the routine, as these will help to build strength and improve overall fitness.

The ""curvy body"" type should focus on exercises that help to tone and strengthen the body, while avoiding bulking up. This could include Pilates, yoga, and bodyweight exercises. Pilates and yoga are particularly beneficial, as they can help to improve flexibility and reduce stress.

Finally, the ""unhealthy body"" type should focus on exercises that will help to improve overall health and fitness. This could include walking, swimming, and cycling. These exercises are low-impact and are ideal for those who are not in good physical shape. Additionally, these exercises can help to improve cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.",1
"The research, published in Nature Communications, is a major milestone in the development of quantum technologies. It demonstrates a technique for controlling individual qubits that is both reliable and robust.

The team, led by Professor Michael Reimer of the Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology, demonstrated a technique called 'cavity-enhanced Raman spectroscopy'. This technique is used to measure the quantum state of individual qubits, which are made of barium atoms.

The team was able to control the qubits with a high degree of accuracy, even in the presence of environmental noise. This is a critical step towards reliably processing quantum information.

The research was conducted in collaboration with researchers from the University of Toronto, the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics, and the University of California, Berkeley.

"A new study has found that people with a positive body image have better life satisfaction, and that people in rural areas have higher levels of body appreciation than those in urban areas.

The study, conducted by researchers from the University of Exeter, is the largest of its kind to date and surveyed over 28,000 people from across the UK.

The study found that people with a positive body image were more likely to report higher levels of life satisfaction than those with a negative body image. This was true for both men and women, and across different ages, ethnicities, and geographical areas.

The study also found that people in rural areas were more likely to report higher levels of body appreciation than those in urban areas. This was particularly true for women, with rural women reporting significantly higher levels of body appreciation compared to their urban counterparts.

The researchers suggest that this could be due to rural women having more access to natural outdoor spaces, and thus being more likely to engage in physical activity and be exposed to positive body image messages.

The study highlights the importance of positive body image in promoting life satisfaction and mental wellbeing, and suggests that interventions to improve body image should take into account geographical location.",1
"on the attitudes of white people. This effect is most pronounced among those who are more prejudiced and more politically conservative. Furthermore, the negative effect decreases over time, with attitudes becoming more tolerant of affirmative action.

The meta-analysis also found that affirmative action has positive effects on the attitudes of minority groups. Minority groups tend to have more positive attitudes towards affirmative action, and this effect is more pronounced among those who are more politically liberal. This positive effect remained steady over time, with attitudes becoming more supportive of affirmative action.

The meta-analysis also found that affirmative action has a positive effect on the attitudes of members of both majority and minority groups towards each other. This effect is most pronounced among those who are more politically liberal. Furthermore, the positive effect remains stable over time.

Overall, the meta-analysis found that affirmative action has both negative and positive effects on the attitudes of both majority and minority groups. While the negative effect is most pronounced among those who are more prejudiced and more politically conservative, the positive effect is more pronounced among those who are more politically liberal. Furthermore, the effects of affirmative action on attitudes appear to remain stable over time.",1

"published in the journal PLOS One.

The study, led by researchers from the University of Exeter in the UK, examined data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) and the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS).

The researchers found that having a hobby was associated with fewer depressive symptoms, higher levels of self-reported health, life satisfaction and happiness in people aged 65 and over across all 16 countries. The strongest associations were found in the UK, Italy, Germany and China.

The findings suggest that having a hobby may be beneficial for older adults, regardless of where they live. The researchers suggest that hobbies may provide older adults with a sense of purpose and social engagement, which can help to reduce feelings of loneliness and depression.

The findings also suggest that encouraging older adults to take up a hobby may be an effective way to improve their health and wellbeing. Further research is needed to determine the best strategies for promoting hobbies among older adults.",1
"One of the most dangerous is the deadly humid heatwave, which is projected to become more frequent and intense as the climate warms.

Humid heatwaves are particularly dangerous because they combine high temperatures with high levels of humidity, making it harder for the body to cool itself through sweat. This can lead to heat stress, dehydration, and other life-threatening conditions.

The risk of these events is expected to increase in the coming decades, particularly in the tropics and subtropics. Countries in the Middle East, parts of Africa, and South Asia are particularly vulnerable.

To mitigate the effects of humid heatwaves, governments must take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prepare for the impacts of climate change. This includes developing early warning systems, improving access to health care, and providing information to the public on how to protect themselves. Additionally, governments should invest in green infrastructure such as green roofs and trees to provide shade and cooling.",1
"When trying to regulate our emotions through music listening, we succeed around half the time, according to a new music psychology experience-sampling study. The study, conducted by researchers from the University of Jyväskylä in Finland, surveyed a sample of Finnish adults to explore how music can be used to manage emotions. The findings revealed that participants used music to regulate their emotions about half the time, with the most commonly reported emotion-management strategies being to listen to uplifting music, to avoid certain types of music, and to distract oneself with music. Additionally, the study also highlighted the importance of individual differences, with some people being more successful at emotion-management than others. These findings suggest that music can be used as a tool for emotion regulation, but that it is not a one-size-fits-all solution.",1

"in forests

It has been found that native diversity can act as a buffer against the severity of non-native tree invasions in forests. Native diversity can help reduce the spread of non-native species by competing with them in terms of resources, such as light, water and soil nutrients, and by providing a physical barrier to the spread of non-native species. Native diversity can also increase the likelihood of native species being more resilient to non-native species, as they may have evolved to better tolerate the presence of non-native species. Additionally, native species may be better adapted to the local environment and therefore may be more successful at competing with non-native species. Finally, native species may be able to recognize and respond to non-native species more quickly, allowing them to outcompete the non-native species.",1

"Sodium butyrate is a short-chain fatty acid that is gaining increasing attention for its potential to modulate mitochondrial function and barrier integrity in human glomerular endothelial cells. Recent studies have revealed that sodium butyrate plays a key role in regulating the mitochondrial bioenergetic state, redox balance, and other important cellular processes. In addition, sodium butyrate has been shown to increase the expression of tight junction proteins, which play an essential role in maintaining the integrity of the glomerular endothelial barrier. Furthermore, sodium butyrate has been demonstrated to promote the proliferation and differentiation of glomerular endothelial cells, and to reduce the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in these cells. Finally, sodium butyrate has also been shown to reduce the apoptosis and necrosis of glomerular endothelial cells, which are associated with the development of glomerulosclerosis.

In the future, further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which sodium butyrate modulates mitochondrial function and barrier integrity in human glomerular endothelial cells. Understanding the underlying molecular pathways involved in these processes will be essential in developing new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of glomerulosclerosis and other glomerular diseases. Moreover, further investigations are needed to identify the optimal concentrations and dosing regimens of sodium butyrate for the treatment of glomerular diseases.",1
"The potential of a low carbohydrate diet to suppress the onset and progression of neuroendocrine tumors is an exciting and promising area of research. Studies have shown that low carbohydrate diets reduce levels of insulin and insulin-like growth factors, which are known to promote the growth of these tumors. Additionally, a low carbohydrate diet can reduce the risk of obesity, which is a known risk factor for these tumors.

Recent studies have demonstrated that a low carbohydrate diet can reduce tumor size and slow the progression of neuroendocrine tumors. In one study, a low carbohydrate diet was able to reduce tumor size in mice with neuroendocrine tumors. In another study, a low carbohydrate diet was able to reduce tumor growth in humans with neuroendocrine tumors.

In addition to its potential for tumor suppression, a low carbohydrate diet may also be beneficial for people with neuroendocrine tumors by improving their overall health. Low carbohydrate diets have been shown to reduce inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity, and reduce cholesterol levels. In addition, such diets may improve quality of life and reduce fatigue associated with these tumors.

Overall, the evidence suggests that a low carbohydrate diet may be beneficial in suppressing the onset and progression of neuroendocrine tumors. However, further research is needed to fully understand the potential of this approach.",1
"Rising temperatures can increase the prevalence of certain infectious diseases, such as malaria, dengue fever, and other mosquito-borne diseases. Changes in precipitation, such as an increase in flooding, can also increase the risk of water-borne diseases, such as cholera and typhoid.

We then discuss the implications of our results for developing personalized interventions to prevent or delay the onset of diabetes. Finally, we discuss the potential for our approach to be applied to other chronic health conditions and how it could be used to improve personalized health care.",1
"The study found that the invasive species had a high level of genetic diversity, with a relatively even distribution of genetic variation across populations. This suggests that the species is highly mobile and can easily migrate between different habitats. The study also revealed that the invasive species had a strong population structure, with distinct genetic clusters in different regions. This suggests that the species is adapting to local environmental conditions and may have the potential to become more widespread and invasive in the future. The findings of this study may help inform management strategies for controlling the spread of the invasive species and preserving the native biodiversity.",1
"Background: Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a member of the sirtuin family of proteins, which have been linked to a wide range of health benefits, including enhanced energy metabolism and improved longevity. SIRT1 has been studied extensively in relation to exercise, as it has been proposed to be involved in mediating the beneficial effects of exercise on health and longevity.

Objectives: This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the response of SIRT1 to exercise.

Search strategy: A comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar was conducted to identify relevant studies published from January 2000 to September 2023. The search terms used were “SIRT1”, “exercise”, “response”, and “physiology”.

Inclusion criteria: Studies were included if they reported data on the response of SIRT1 to exercise, and if they were published in English.

Data extraction and synthesis: Data from eligible studies were extracted and pooled using a random effects model.

Results: A total of 17 studies were included in the analysis. The pooled data showed that exercise significantly increased SIRT1 activity (Hedges’ g = 0.82, 95% CI 0.58-1.06, p < 0.001). There was significant heterogeneity among the studies (I2 = 87.5%, p < 0.001).

Conclusion: This systematic review and meta-analysis provides evidence that exercise is associated with an increase in SIRT1 activity. These findings could have important implications for health and longevity. Future studies should focus on the potential mechanisms underlying the observed effects and the potential clinical implications of SIRT1 modulation.",1
"This study will investigate the effects of a gradual fragmentation of the day-night cycle on circadian-driven locomotor rhythms in mice. The experiment will involve subjecting groups of mice to a day-night cycle that is gradually fragmented over a period of time. The fragmentation will be achieved by introducing increasingly longer periods of darkness to the day-night cycle, while keeping the same overall length of the cycle. The locomotor activity of the mice will be monitored throughout the study.

The primary outcome measure of this study will be the degree of suppression of the circadian-driven locomotor rhythms of the mice. This will be assessed by comparing the locomotor activity of the mice in the fragmented day-night cycle to that of a control group of mice exposed to a normal day-night cycle. The degree of suppression will be determined by measuring the decrease in the amplitude and period of the locomotor activity rhythms.

Secondary outcome measures will include the degree of desynchronization of the locomotor activity between individual mice, as well as changes in the activity of other physiological processes such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

This study will provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the effects of day-night cycle fragmentation on circadian-driven locomotor rhythms. It will also have important implications for understanding the effects of shift work and other forms of circadian disruption on human health and well-being.",1
"The numbers on a jersey are often associated with the size of the player wearing it. This is because lower numbers are typically worn by smaller, faster players, while higher numbers are worn by larger, more physical players. This can lead to players choosing lower numbers in order to appear slimmer and faster. Experiments have shown that people consistently perceive players in lower numbers as thinner than those in higher numbers, even when they have the same body size. This suggests that learned associations between numbers and sizes can influence perceptions of body size.",1
"This has been observed in both the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and large-scale structure data. This suppression of cosmic structure growth is thought to be caused by the presence of dark energy, an unknown form of energy that is causing the universe to expand at an accelerating rate.

Astronomers are currently studying this phenomenon in an effort to better understand the nature of dark energy and the universe.",1
"The study, published in the journal Psychological Science, found that a positive worldview is less associated with indicators of privilege than expected. The study surveyed 1,926 people from diverse backgrounds in the United States and found that those with higher levels of privilege were no more likely to have a positive outlook than those with lower levels of privilege.

The study also found that people with higher levels of privilege were more likely to have a negative outlook than those with lower levels of privilege. This suggests that a positive worldview is not necessarily linked to privilege.

The study's authors suggest that the findings could be attributed to the fact that people with higher levels of privilege may be more aware of the difficulties faced by those with lower levels of privilege, which could lead to a more pessimistic outlook overall.

The findings of this study suggest that a positive worldview is not necessarily tied to privilege. People of all backgrounds have the potential to have a positive outlook on life, and it is important to foster an environment that encourages this.",1
"Yes, the US tobacco companies have selectively disseminated hyper-palatable foods into the US food system. This has been documented in various studies, which have found that the tobacco companies have used their marketing strategies to target certain populations, such as children and low-income groups, with hyper-palatable foods. These foods are often high in sugar, fat, and salt, and are designed to be highly appealing and addictive. This has been linked to rising rates of obesity and chronic diseases in the US, and has led to increased public health concerns. The implications of this are significant, as it has the potential to create a cycle of unhealthy eating habits that can be difficult to break. A comprehensive approach to addressing this issue is needed, including policy interventions, education, and public health campaigns aimed at promoting healthier food options and limiting the appeal of hyper-palatable foods.",1

That's great! There are a few things you can do to help make life easier for your colorblind friend. First, make sure to label items with words rather than relying on color. You can also use apps or websites that can help your friend identify colors. Additionally, make sure to avoid patterns that rely heavily on color, as they can be difficult to distinguish.

"The Ig Nobel Prizes are a tongue-in-cheek celebration of the strange and unusual in the world of science. The prizes, awarded annually since 1991, recognize research that “first makes people laugh, and then makes them think.” Among the Ig Nobel winners over the years are scientists who studied smart toilets, the effects of licking rocks, and the behavior of chickens in jigsaw puzzles.

The Ig Nobel Prizes are organized by the scientific humor magazine Annals of Improbable Research. The awards ceremony is held each year at Harvard University, and winners receive a cash prize of 10 trillion Zimbabwean dollars. The ceremony is known for its light-heartedness, with a Nobel laureate distributing the awards and a marching band playing during the ceremony.

Some of the more unusual Ig Nobel Prize-winning studies include a 2020 study of the effects of licking rocks, a 2015 study of whether chicken’s can solve jigsaw puzzles, and a 2001 study of the “smart toilet” that identifies its user. The smart toilet was created by a team of Japanese scientists and was designed to recognize users by their weight, height, and body shape. Other intriguing Ig Nobel Prize winners include a study of the behavior of cows in a magnetic field, a study of the effects of listening to opera music on mice, and a study of the effects of swearing on pain tolerance.

The Ig Nobel Prizes provide a unique opportunity to celebrate the strange and unusual in science. By recognizing research that is both amusing and thought-provoking, the Ig Nobel Prizes encourage scientists to think outside the box and explore the unexpected.",1

Finally, don’t forget to check out thrift stores and yard sales. Many people donate their gently used supplies to these places, and you may be able to find some great deals.

"The history of the New Mexican alien dates back to the late 19th century. This group of immigrants, mostly from Mexico, began to arrive in the United States in the late 1800s and early 1900s, searching for a better life and greater economic opportunity. As the United States economy grew, so did the number of immigrants from Mexico.

By the 1920s, the Mexican population in New Mexico had grown significantly and many of these immigrants had become permanent residents of the state. As they settled in, they became an integral part of the local economy, providing labor for agricultural, industrial, and service industries.

The New Mexican alien population faced several challenges in the United States. They faced discrimination and racism, particularly in the early years, and were often denied basic civil rights. In addition, they faced language and cultural barriers, as well as economic hardship. Despite these challenges, the New Mexican alien population managed to thrive and integrate into the local community.

Today, the New Mexican alien population is still a vibrant and important part of the state's economy and culture. They are an integral part of the local economy, providing labor for a variety of industries, and are active in the local political and cultural scene. They are a vital part of the state's history and identity, and their contributions are an integral part of what makes New Mexico unique.",1

"There are several factors that contribute to why people may not be complaining to the US government about wages and such not keeping up with rent and house prices. 

First, many people may simply not be aware that their wages are not keeping up with rent and house prices. In addition, people may not realize that they have the power to make their voices heard in the political process. They may not be aware of the channels available to them to voice their concerns or the impact their participation can have on the policy-making process. 

Second, people may not be willing to take the time and energy to engage in the political process. It can be difficult and time-consuming to attend protests, write to elected officials, or even just fill out a survey. People’s lives are already busy and it can be hard to make the time to participate in politics. 

Finally, some people may not feel that their voice will make a difference. They may feel that their opinion doesn’t matter or that the government will not listen to them. This can be especially true for people in lower-income brackets who may feel that their opinion is not valued or taken seriously.

"One of the most horrific cases of mental disharmony I have ever encountered in my career was a young man who had been diagnosed with severe schizophrenia. He was completely unable to distinguish between reality and delusion, and his behavior was unpredictable and often violent. He was unable to care for himself, and his family had to take him in and provide full-time care. His delusions were so extreme that he believed he was possessed by an evil spirit, and he would often lash out physically and verbally in an attempt to escape its control. His condition was heartbreaking to witness and impossible to treat, and he eventually passed away due to complications related to his illness.",1
"Reddit's obsession with fascist topics and ideologies stems from a combination of factors. On the one hand, it can be seen as a form of rebellion against mainstream culture and politics, as Reddit has become a place for people to express their dissenting views without fear of censorship or repercussions.

Fascism is also often associated with a certain level of machismo, which is attractive to some people.

"Doomed is a strong word, but humanity would certainly face a lot of challenges. Firstly, Tinder is a platform that is heavily based on physical attractiveness and appearance, so it would be difficult for people to find meaningful relationships without having to prioritize looks over personality. There would also be a lack of diversity in terms of relationship types, as Tinder only offers the opportunity for heterosexual and monogamous relationships. Furthermore, the app would be limited to the people who have access to it, meaning those in more remote areas would be at a disadvantage. Ultimately, while Tinder could be a useful tool for people to find love and relationships, relying solely on it for such matters would be detrimental to humanity as a whole.",1

"I was born and raised in prison, so I remember it very well. It was very difficult to grow up in such a restricted environment and it had a huge impact on my development. Growing up in prison, I felt isolated and disconnected from the outside world. I was surrounded by adults who were serving long sentences and, as a result, I felt like I was missing out on a lot of life experiences that other children my age were having. I was also deprived of the social and emotional support that a family or community can provide. In addition, the prison environment was often violent and oppressive. This had a profound effect on my mental health and sense of self-worth. Despite all of this, I was determined to make the best of my situation and use my time in prison to become a better person. I was able to take advantage of educational and vocational programs offered in prison and I eventually earned my GED. I also took up writing and photography as hobbies and eventually published a book of my prison experiences. All of these experiences have shaped me into the person I am today.",1

4. Show patience and understanding. Asexuality is still not widely understood, so it is important to be patient and understanding of each other.

5. Explore different types of intimacy. Asexuality doesn't mean there is no intimacy, just that it may look different. Find ways to connect that don't involve physical contact.

6. Seek help if needed. If you are having difficulty understanding or adjusting to the differences between you, consider seeking help from a therapist or counselor who is experienced in working with couples in which one partner is asexual.",1
"1. Acknowledge that your expectations and timeline for success may be unrealistic. Everyone’s life journey is unique, and it is ok if you are not where you thought you would be at this point in your life.

3. Celebrate your successes. Celebrate the small successes and recognize the effort you’ve put in to get to where you are today.

4. Challenge negative thoughts. When negative thoughts arise, challenge them by reframing your perspective and looking at the situation in a more positive light.

5. Ask for help. Don’t be afraid to reach out to friends, family, or professionals if you need assistance.

6. Take care of yourself. Self-care is essential for managing stress and improving self-esteem. Make time for activities that bring you joy and make you feel good.",1

"is a relatively new phenomenon that is largely fueled by the increasing popularity of video games. The rise of the internet has made it easier than ever before for gamers to access information about upcoming releases, from trailers to pre-release reviews. This has led to a culture of anticipation and speculation surrounding upcoming releases, as gamers eagerly await news and updates.

The trend of pre-release information gathering can be seen in many ways. For instance, the most popular gaming websites now regularly post articles and videos about upcoming releases. Social media has become a powerful tool for fans to share their thoughts and opinions on upcoming games, and to spread the word about new releases. Additionally, many gaming companies now offer pre-order bonuses, such as exclusive content or early access to the game, as an incentive to purchase the game before its release.

The trend of pre-release information gathering has both positive and negative implications. On the one hand, it can help to build hype and excitement for upcoming releases, allowing gamers to experience the anticipation and excitement of a game’s launch. On the other hand, it can also lead to unrealistic expectations and disappointment if the game does not live up to the hype. Additionally, some developers have been known to withhold information about their games until the last minute, which can lead to frustration among fans.

Ultimately, the trend of pre-release information gathering is likely to continue as long as video games remain popular. Whether this trend is a good or bad thing will depend on the individual and how they use the information they gain.",1

"In a surprise move, Bill Willingham, the creator of the Fables comic book series, has placed the universe of his popular Wolf Among Us video game adaptation in the public domain. Willingham's decision to do so comes amid a clash with DC Comics over the future of the game's adaptation.

The Wolf Among Us video game, which was developed by Telltale Games and released in 2014, was based on the Fables comic book series. In 2018, Telltale Games shut down and the rights to the game were acquired by LCG Entertainment. LCG has since announced plans to develop a sequel to the game, but Willingham has expressed concerns that the new version would not properly honor the original.

In a statement, Willingham said that he had decided to place the Wolf Among Us universe in the public domain to ensure that his vision for the game would be preserved. He said that he hoped his decision would encourage others to create stories and games set in the Wolf Among Us universe, and that he would not seek any compensation for his work.

Willingham's decision to place the Wolf Among Us universe in the public domain will likely have far-reaching implications for the future of the game and the Fables comic book series.

The studio’s general manager, Casey Hudson, wrote in a blog post that the layoffs were “necessary” in order to “better deliver on our future projects.” He also said that the studio had to “make some difficult decisions” in order to ensure that the studio was “structured in the right way” for future projects.

The layoffs come at a difficult time for the studio, which has been struggling to make a successful game since the release of Mass Effect 3 in 2012. While the studio has seen some success with the Dragon Age and Mass Effect series, its most recent game, Anthem, has been a disappointment. The game was met with mixed reviews and has failed to make a lasting impression on the gaming community.

BioWare is now focusing on two upcoming projects: Dragon Age 4 and the next installment of the Mass Effect series. It’s unclear if the studio will be able to turn around its fortunes with these games, but the layoffs are a sign that the studio is taking steps to ensure its future projects are successful.",1

"The Roanoke Colony, located on the island of Roanoke off the coast of North Carolina, was the first attempt by the English to establish a permanent settlement in the New World. It was founded in 1585 by Sir Walter Raleigh and was home to about 115 English settlers.

In 1590, after several years of difficulty, the colonists suddenly disappeared without a trace. To this day, their fate remains a mystery. There are several theories as to what happened to the colonists, including that they were killed by Native Americans, they assimilated with local tribes, or they relocated to another area.

The most widely accepted theory is that the Roanoke colonists were killed by Native Americans, possibly due to a conflict over resources. This theory has been supported by archaeological evidence, such as the discovery of bones and artifacts belonging to the colonists.

However, there is also evidence to suggest that the colonists may have assimilated with the local tribes and relocated to another area. In 1590, John White, the leader of the Roanoke expedition, returned to the island to find the settlement deserted. He found the word “Croatoan” carved into a tree, which was the name of a nearby Native American tribe. This suggests that the colonists may have assimilated with the local tribes and relocated to another area.

This system allows for cross-jurisdictional searches, making it easier for law enforcement to find missing children and reunite them with their families.

In addition, the California Department of Justice has created the California Missing and Unidentified Persons Clearinghouse, which is a centralized repository for missing persons information.

The investigation was reopened in 2017 after a family member of Laughlin's had submitted a DNA sample to the DNA Doe Project, a non-profit organization that uses genetic genealogy to identify the remains of unidentified persons. After the DNA sample was submitted, a match was found with a missing persons report from California in 1978. This report was then used to identify the remains as Laughlin's.

"The story of the lost children of California is a heartbreaking one. In the early 20th century, many children in California were placed in orphanages and foster homes due to poverty, family disputes, and other issues. The children were often mistreated and neglected, and some were even sold as slaves. While most of these children were eventually reunited with their families, some were never found. 

In the 1990s, a group of volunteers began searching for these lost children. They traveled across the state, interviewing former foster care providers, orphanage administrators, and other people who might have information about the missing children. They also searched through old records and newspapers in an effort to find clues. 

The volunteers’ efforts paid off, and they were able to locate and reunite many of the lost children with their families. Unfortunately, many of them remain missing to this day. The volunteers continue to search for these lost children, hoping that one day they will be able to find them and reunite them with their families.",1

"On the morning of August 15th, 1976, a farmer was plowing his land in Waukesha County, Wisconsin when he made a startling discovery. Buried in the ground beneath him was the body of a young female, who had been dead for some time. She was estimated to be between the ages of 15 and 25, and had been buried in a shallow grave for at least two and a half years.

The young woman had been shot in the head, and her body was badly decomposed. She had been wearing a yellow blouse and blue jeans at the time of her death. Her hair was described as being dark brown, and she had a pierced left ear.

Investigators were unable to identify the young woman, and she became known as the Waukesha County Jane Doe. Despite efforts to identify her, the case went cold and the identity of the woman remained unknown for over 40 years.

In 2018, investigators decided to try to use DNA technology to identify the woman, and were successful in doing so. She was identified as Laura Ann Taylor, a 19-year-old from Milwaukee who had been missing since 1974. Her killer was never identified.

"At this point, almost eight years after the disappearance of nursing student Holly Bobo, the mystery of her murder may still remain unsolved. On April 13, 2011, Bobo left her home in Darden, Tennessee, and was never seen again. Her remains were found in September 2014, but her killer has never been identified.

The case has baffled investigators since the beginning. There are several possible explanations as to why the case has remained unsolved for so long.

The first is that the investigation was hampered by a lack of evidence. Bobo was last seen in a wooded area, and the search for her proved difficult due to the dense vegetation. Furthermore, the area had been disturbed by ATV riders and other activity, making it difficult to find any evidence that could point to a potential suspect.

Another possible explanation is that the investigation was hindered by a lack of cooperation from the community. Despite the fact that Bobo's disappearance was widely reported in the media, many people in the community remained tight-lipped about what they knew. This could have been due to fear of retaliation, or simply a general unwillingness to get involved.

Finally, it is possible that the case has remained unsolved due to a lack of resources and manpower. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has a limited budget and staff, and the case has been ongoing for almost eight years. This means that the investigators have had to prioritize their time and resources, and the case may have taken a backseat to more pressing matters.

For whatever reason, the case of Holly Bobo's murder has yet to be solved. While there is still hope that the killer will be found, it is important to remember that justice can take a long time to be served.",1
"Holly Bobo's murder remains unsolved for a multitude of reasons. First, the crime scene was compromised due to a lack of timely and proper evidence collection. Additionally, the investigation was hampered by a lack of witnesses and reliable leads. Furthermore, the perpetrator of the crime has never been identified, and the physical evidence that was collected has been inconclusive.

The lack of timely and proper evidence collection at the crime scene was a major contributor to the case remaining unsolved. Despite the fact that Holly's brother witnessed her abduction, the police did not arrive at the scene until almost two hours later. By the time they arrived, the crime scene had been compromised, and the evidence that could have been collected was gone.

In addition, the investigation was hindered by a lack of witnesses and reliable leads. While Holly's brother was able to provide a description of the abductor, he was unable to provide any further information. Additionally, despite the fact that a number of people were interviewed as part of the investigation, no solid leads were ever uncovered.

Finally, the physical evidence that was collected was inconclusive. While DNA was found at the scene, it was not tested until several years later, and the results were inconclusive. Furthermore, no further physical evidence was discovered that could have helped to identify the perpetrator.

In conclusion, Holly Bobo's murder is still unsolved due to a variety of factors, including a lack of timely and proper evidence collection, a lack of witnesses and reliable leads, and inconclusive physical evidence.",1
"The Servant Girl Annihilator case is one of the oldest unsolved serial murder cases in the United States. The case began on December 24, 1884, when two African-American women, Mollie Smith and Irene Cross, were found brutally murdered in the East Austin neighborhood of Austin, Texas. Over the course of the next several months, a total of eight women were killed in similar fashion, all of them African-American servants. 

The victims were stabbed or bludgeoned to death and their bodies were found in areas of East Austin that were within a few blocks of each other. The police had very few clues to work with and the case quickly became a mystery. Despite a number of suspects being investigated, no one was ever arrested or charged with the murders. 

The case remains unsolved to this day, but there have been many theories as to who the killer might have been. Some believe the murderer may have been a drifter or a transient who was passing through the area. Others believe the killer was someone from the local community who may have had a grudge against the African-American servant girls. 

The Servant Girl Annihilator case has been the subject of numerous books, articles, and documentaries over the years, and continues to fascinate many people. The case remains unsolved, but it is still remembered as one of the most notorious unsolved serial murder cases in the United States.",1

"The tragic murder of the twin Kahui brothers, Cris and Cru, occurred in June 2006 in New Zealand. The twins were just three months old when their father, Chris Kahui, found them dead in their crib. Chris called the police and an investigation was launched. Initially, Chris was charged with the murder, but the charges were later dropped due to lack of evidence. To this day, the case remains unsolved, and the twins' deaths are still considered a cold case.

The case has sparked a great deal of public attention in New Zealand, with some believing that the twins' mother, Macsyna King, was responsible for the murders. This theory is based on the fact that King had a history of mental health issues and had been known to suffer from violent outbursts. However, a lack of evidence means that this theory has never been proven and the case remains unsolved.

Questions surrounding the twins' deaths have been raised for years, and the case has been the subject of numerous documentaries, books, and articles. In 2014, a coroner's inquest was held, but it failed to uncover any new evidence. As such, the twins' deaths remain a mystery and the case remains unsolved.",1

Giarre had been living in Chicago for only a few months when she was killed. She had been visiting her family in the Dominican Republic, and was planning to move to the city permanently. Her death was a shock to her friends and family, as she had been a beloved member of the LGBT+ community in the Dominican Republic.

The investigation into her death has been ongoing for over a year, and has been hampered by the lack of witnesses and evidence. The Chicago Police Department has asked the public for any information that might help in the investigation, but so far, no leads have been found.

The unsolved murder of Giarre Santos has had a profound effect on the LGBT+ community in Chicago. Giarre's death has highlighted the dangers that transgender women of color face, and her case has become a symbol of the need for increased protections for this vulnerable population.

He had planned to stay in and watch a movie, but as the night wore on, he felt a strange urge to go explore the nearby woods.

Hours later, Raymond was still wandering through the woods, his panic mounting as the night grew longer. Suddenly, a bright light appeared in the sky and a loud buzzing noise filled the air.

At the time of her death, Vergata had been missing for about two weeks and her family had filed a missing persons report with the NYPD.

The Commission found that the police had planted evidence in order to secure Thomas's conviction, and that Thomas had been wrongfully convicted. Thomas was pardoned and the case was closed. 

To this day, the murders of Harvey and Jeannette Crewe remain unsolved. The case has become a part of New Zealand's legal history, and is a reminder of the potential for miscarriages of justice.",1
"The Servant Girl Annihilator was a serial killer who terrorized Austin, Texas, in the late 19th century. The killer was responsible for the deaths of at least 8 people, all of whom were African American women or girls, and the attacks occurred between December 1884 and December 1885. The victims were found brutally beaten and strangled, and some were sexually assaulted.

The killer was never identified, and the murders remain unsolved to this day. However, there have been a number of suspects over the years, including a former slave named Jesse Washington, a freedman named Jack the Stripper, and even a local pharmacist named Dr. John Hale.

The Servant Girl Annihilator case has been cited as an example of the rampant racism and sexism of the time period, as all of the victims were African American and female. It is also a reminder of how little progress has been made in solving such cases, as the killer was never found, despite the best efforts of investigators.",1

"On November 9th, 2007, 22-year-old Kyle Fleischmann disappeared from a Charlotte, North Carolina bar. His family and friends were immediately concerned and police launched an investigation into his disappearance. Though the investigation was extensive, police were unable to uncover any evidence of foul play or any other clues as to what happened to Kyle. 

Several theories have been proposed to explain Kyle’s disappearance. The first is that he was abducted. This theory is based on the fact that there were multiple reports of a suspicious vehicle in the area that night. It is possible that Kyle was abducted by someone in the vehicle. However, there is no evidence to support this theory, and it is unlikely that Kyle would have been abducted without any witnesses.

The second theory is that Kyle was murdered. This is based on the fact that there were reports of a fight outside the bar that night, and Kyle was known to be a peaceful person. However, there is no evidence to support this theory either, and it is unlikely that someone would murder Kyle without any witnesses.

The third theory is that Kyle simply left the bar and got lost. This is possible, as Kyle was known to be an adventurous person who enjoyed exploring new places. He was also known to be an avid hiker and was known to go on long hikes in the area. It is possible that he got lost while exploring and was unable to find his way back.

The fourth theory is that Kyle left the bar and committed suicide. This is based on reports that Kyle was depressed and had been drinking heavily that night. It is possible that he decided to take his own life, but there is no evidence to support this theory.

The suspect, 79-year-old Stephen Blake Crawford, was a former minister at a church in San Diego who is suspected of killing 25-year-old Linda Ann O’Keefe. O’Keefe’s body was found in a ditch near the Newport Beach Back Bay in July of 1975.

The arrest of Crawford has provided a sense of closure to O’Keefe’s family, who had been searching for answers for over 40 years.",1

"Henry Lee, a former forensic scientist, has been found liable by a federal judge for fabricating evidence during the trial of a now-overturned conviction.

The case at hand involved the wrongful conviction of a man named Alfred Swinton, who was charged with murder in the 1990s. Swinton was convicted largely based on evidence that was provided by Lee during his testimony at trial. This evidence included a pair of shoes that Lee claimed belonged to Swinton, and that contained DNA evidence linking him to the crime.

However, it was later revealed that the shoes had been tampered with, and that the DNA evidence had been planted by Lee. This evidence was later found to be false, leading to the overturning of Swinton's conviction in 2003.

In his ruling, the judge found that Lee had acted recklessly and had violated his professional duties as a forensic scientist. The judge also found that Lee had acted with ""gross negligence,"" and had caused Swinton to suffer emotional distress as a result of his wrongful conviction.

The judge ordered Lee to pay Swinton $2.7 million in damages. Lee has since apologized for his actions, and has expressed regret for the harm he caused.",1

In 2020, the Union County Prosecutor’s Office’s Cold Case Unit, in collaboration with Parabon NanoLabs, used a cutting-edge technique called forensic genetic genealogy to identify Laura’s killer. Forensic genetic genealogy combines traditional genealogical research with DNA analysis to identify suspects by comparing crime scene DNA to public genealogy databases.

The successful resolution of the case has made Laura Kempton’s murder the first in Union County to be solved using forensic genetic genealogy. The use of this technique has opened up new possibilities for solving cold cases and bringing justice to victims and their families.",1

"The story of the lost children of California is a heartbreaking and complex one. It began in the early 2000s, when the California foster care system was overwhelmed with a large number of children in need of care. During this time, many of the children were placed in group homes and other facilities that were not properly monitored or supervised. As a result, some of these children went missing and were never found.

The situation was so dire that the California state legislature passed a law in 2006, the Missing and Exploited Children’s Act, which created a statewide task force to investigate cases of missing and exploited children. The task force has worked with law enforcement, social services, and other agencies to locate missing children and reunite them with their families.

Despite these efforts, many of the lost children of California remain missing to this day. The task force continues to search for them, hoping to bring these children home and reunite them with their families.",1

"Reddit has been the source of much consternation for third-party application developers over the past few years. This is largely due to Reddit's decision to no longer allow developers to make use of its API and other data in order to create applications that interact with the site. This has had a particularly negative impact on developers who had created popular third-party applications that allowed users to access Reddit content in a more streamlined, user-friendly way.

The decision to block access to the API and other data has been a major blow for many developers, and it has caused many of the popular third-party applications to shut down. This has left Reddit users with fewer options for accessing the site's content, and has also caused some to question whether Reddit is actually killing itself by cutting off third-party developers.

Reddit's decision to block access to its API and other data has been met with a lot of criticism, and many Reddit users are concerned that the site is no longer as open and welcoming as it once was. Reddit has responded by stating that it is merely trying to protect its users from malicious actors, but many developers and users are still unhappy with the decision.

"I was once asked to be a translator for a business meeting between two companies. One was based in the US and the other in the UK. The meeting was held in the US, and the UK company had sent representatives who all spoke English but had a strong British accent.

The US company had requested that I be present to translate any of the UK representatives' remarks that their US colleagues could not understand. I agreed, and the meeting began.

At first, I was a little apprehensive about my role. I wasn't sure how I was supposed to translate English into English. But as the meeting proceeded, I realized that I wasn't actually translating; I was simply repeating what the UK representatives had said, but in a more neutral American accent.

My role was to make sure everyone at the meeting could understand each other. I found myself repeating words and phrases in a way that was easier for the US participants to understand. I also worked to clarify any misunderstandings by asking questions and making sure everyone was on the same page.

In the end, the meeting was a success, and I was proud to have been a part of it. I had played an important role in helping two companies from different parts of the world communicate with each other. It was a great experience, and I learned a lot about translation and communication.",1

One day, Abigail decided to surprise all of her family and friends with something special. She went to the store and bought a huge bag of candy. She knew that everyone would love it and it would bring a smile to their faces.

One way to avoid the “I don’t work here” situation is to be polite and direct in your approach. Instead of simply saying “I don’t work here,” explain the situation in a more helpful way. For example, you could say, “I’m sorry, I’m not familiar with this store, but I can try to help you find what you’re looking for.” By doing this, you’re showing that you’re willing to help, and that you’re not just trying to brush them off.

The reactions you get when you approach the situation this way can vary greatly depending on the person. Some people may be grateful for your help and be appreciative that you’re willing to try to help them. Others may be more suspicious and not believe that you’re not actually an employee.

She started to rant about how she had been in the store for an hour and the store was out of her favorite brand of chips. She was so angry that she was demanding to speak to a manager. I attempted to calm her down and asked her if there was anything else she needed. She ignored me and continued to demand to speak to a manager. 

At this point, I was getting frustrated and asked her to please leave me alone so I could finish my shopping. She refused and kept demanding to speak to a manager.

The woman was still there, and she was even more angry than before. She started to yell at me and demand that I find her a manager. I was getting fed up and told her that I had done my best and that she needed to leave me alone. 

That's when the real battle began. She started to call me names and insult me. I was so angry that I started to raise my voice and told her to leave me alone. I could see the other shoppers in the store staring in disbelief. 

Finally, I had enough and told her that I was going to call the police if she didn't leave me alone. This seemed to do the trick and she finally stormed off. I was relieved that the situation was over, but I was also embarrassed that I had let the situation get so out of hand.

I recently went on a road trip with my friends. We had been planning it for months, and we were all so excited to finally go. We drove for hours and hours, stopping only for bathroom breaks and snacks. We were having a blast, singing along to the radio and telling stories.

At one point, we stopped at a gas station to fill up. While we were there, I noticed a small, black kitten wandering around the parking lot. I had to do something, so I scooped it up and brought it with us.

We named her Midnight and she quickly became the centerpiece of our journey. We'd take turns holding her and talking to her, and she'd make us laugh with her playful antics. We all fell in love with her and we knew we couldn't leave her behind when our trip was over.

So, we decided to take her home with us. We all chipped in to buy her food and supplies, and she's been living with us ever since.

It's been a few months since our road trip, and Midnight has become a beloved member of our family. We all take turns caring for her, and she's a constant source of joy for us.

"Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Julia who lived in a small village with her family. Julia was a bright and energetic girl who loved to explore the world around her.

One day, Julia discovered an old abandoned house in the woods near her village. She was curious to find out more about it, so she decided to explore inside.

As Julia ventured deeper into the house, she noticed a strange door at the end of a long hallway. She opened the door and was surprised to find a beautiful garden full of exotic plants and flowers. 

Julia was delighted by the sight of the garden and decided to explore it further. She soon discovered a small pond with a stone bridge leading to an island in the middle. On the island, she found a small cottage with a warm and inviting atmosphere.

When Julia opened the door of the cottage, she was welcomed by a kind old woman who introduced herself as Idwh. Idwh explained that she had been living in the cottage for many years and that the garden was her special place.

Idwh then invited Julia to stay in the cottage with her. Julia happily accepted and soon the two became close friends. Idwh taught Julia about the plants and flowers in the garden, and Julia helped Idwh with her chores.

Together, the two of them explored the garden, shared stories, and enjoyed the peace and tranquility of the cottage. Julia was filled with a newfound appreciation for the beauty of nature, and Idwh was filled with joy from having a new friend.

Their friendship lasted for many years, and Julia often thought back to the day she discovered the old house in the woods. She was grateful that she had taken the time to explore it, as it had led her to the most wonderful friendship she had ever known.",1

The entitled man was driving in a small town when he saw a group of truckers parked in a lot, and decided to do something stupid. He honked his horn and flipped them off as he drove by. Little did he know, the truckers had seen him and decided to follow him.

When the entitled man realized he was being followed, he tried to speed away, but the truckers were faster. They eventually caught up to him and boxed his car in. When he rolled down his window, the truckers began to berate him and demand an apology. 

The entitled man was so scared that he agreed to apologize and promised to never mess with truckers or their friends again. The truckers finally let him go, and he quickly drove away, never to be seen again.

This experience taught the entitled man a valuable lesson: never mess with truckers or their friends. Not only are truckers tough and strong, but they also have a tight-knit community that is always willing to help and protect each other.

Background

The 28-year-old Ige is a native of Hawaii and trains out of the MMA Lab in Glendale, Arizona.

He has been competing professionally since 2013 and has had a successful run in the regional scene.

Ige has competed for the likes of Bellator, King of the Cage, and RFA, and he is currently signed to the UFC.

In his UFC debut, Ige defeated Danny Henry via unanimous decision.

He has since gone on to win three of his four fights in the Octagon, with his most recent win coming against Edson Barboza at UFC on ESPN 8.

Fighting Style

Ige is an aggressive striker who loves to keep the pressure on his opponents.

He will often come forward with a combination of punches and kicks and will look to overwhelm his opponents with volume and power.

Ige is also a proficient grappler and is more than capable of taking the fight to the ground if he needs to.

He has a black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and is very good at using his size and strength to his advantage in the grappling exchanges.

Strengths

Ige has a great combination of size and power that makes him a very dangerous striker.

He is also a very good grappler, and his size and strength make it difficult for his opponents to escape his submissions.

He is also a very aggressive fighter and is always looking to take the fight to his opponents and put them on the defensive.

Weaknesses

Ige can be a bit too aggressive at times, and this can lead to him getting into trouble on the feet.

He also has a tendency to fade in the later rounds, which could be a problem against a more experienced opponent.

Also, while he is a very good grappler, his submissions are not always on point, and he can be taken down if his opponents are able to get inside his guard.",1

Suddenly, the fox started to laugh. It was a loud, deep laugh that echoed through the woods. Mary couldn't help but giggle too, and soon the two of them were laughing together.

In 2017, a captured shark in the waters off the coast of Australia helped solve a murder case. 

The murder victim was a man named Peter Clarkson, who went missing after going out on a fishing trip in August of 2016. His body was never found, but his boat was discovered with the engine running and its navigation system still active. 

After months of investigation, police were unable to find any clues as to what happened to Peter. That is, until they captured a large tiger shark in the waters off the coast of Australia.

According to recent reports, the number of immigrants arriving on the island has more than doubled in the last month, with over 4,000 people arriving in the last week alone.

"Unfortunately, there is no easy answer to this problem. Rent is often determined by the market, which is driven by supply and demand. In order to reduce rent prices, more affordable housing needs to be built or existing housing needs to be made more affordable. Governments can also intervene by providing subsidies or rent control policies, but this can be difficult to implement and may not be enough to make a significant difference. Ultimately, the best solution is to create more affordable housing and increase wages so that people can afford to pay their rent.",1

The infighting has been largely driven by a divide between those who want to take a hardline stance against illegal immigration and those who are more moderate in their approach. The hardliners have accused the moderates of being too soft on immigration policies, while the moderates have argued that the hardliners’ tactics could backfire and lead to a backlash from the public.

The divisions have been especially apparent in recent weeks, with hardliners organizing protests outside homes of local officials who are perceived as being too lenient on immigration issues. Meanwhile, moderates have sought to tone down the rhetoric and focus on more productive conversations with elected officials.

It is unclear if the infighting will lead to a resolution or if it will simply continue to create tension between the two camps. However, it is clear that the issue of immigration remains a highly contentious issue in Staten Island and it is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon.",1
