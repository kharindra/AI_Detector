0,Men's shoulder-to-hip ratios influence neurophysiological responses related to perception and attractiveness,"Y'all, the point isn't that they confirmed that broad shoulders are attractive. The idea is to figure out *why* and *how that works neurologically*. We really don't have a finely detailed understanding of how the brain works, and anything we can learn about it will contribute to all of neurology.",". Men who have shoulder-to-hip ratios of 0.9 or higher are perceived to be more attractive, and studies have found that women tend to have higher levels of neurophysiological arousal when exposed to images of men with higher shoulder-to-hip ratios. This effect is thought to be due to a combination of evolutionary and cultural preferences, as men with higher shoulder-to-hip ratios are seen as more physically fit and dominant."
1,"Pro-circle arguments for a new futuristic city in Saudi Arabia, which is planning to build it in unusual shape of a 170km line that will likely inconvenience 9 million future residents.","Who would willingly live in a super long prison in the middle of the desert? I mean come on, this project won’t be completed. This is nothing more than rich Saudi shenanigans. Maybe if 500 billion was invested into what already exists 20% of the population wouldn’t be poor.","1. This new futuristic city will create an unprecedented level of efficiency and convenience for its residents. By having a linear infrastructure, traffic and travel times will be drastically reduced, allowing for more time to be spent on leisure activities and other pursuits.

2. The city will be more eco-friendly, as the linear design will reduce the amount of land that needs to be developed, thus preserving more of the natural environment.

3. The linear design of the city will also make it easier to plan and build, as it will require less construction and infrastructure than a traditional city. This will create cost savings for the city and its residents.

4. The linear design of the city will also create a unique aesthetic that will attract tourists and businesses from around the world. This influx of people will bring economic growth and job opportunities to the city.

5. The linear design of the city will also create a sense of community and connectedness among its residents, as they will all be living in close proximity to one another and be able to easily interact with each other."
2,"Researchers have successfully transferred a gene to produce tobacco plants that lack pollen and viable seeds, while otherwise growing normally","For those unfamiliar, tobacco is a plant that is easy to work with for genetic experiments. Thats why they chose it. Nobody is actually trying to improve tobacco plants for the sake of better tobacco.",".

Yes, this is possible. Scientists have used genetic engineering techniques to create a variety of plants that are sterile, meaning they lack the ability to produce pollen and viable seeds. These plants have been created in a variety of crops, including tobacco. The genetic modification used to create these plants involves the introduction of a gene that disrupts the plant’s reproductive cycle, preventing it from producing pollen and viable seeds. This technique is commonly used to produce hybrid plants, which have desirable traits but are unable to reproduce."
3,Boosting the ‘warm glow’ feeling that people experience after giving blood significantly increases repeat blood donations. Warm-glow messaging resulted in over a 6% increase (approximately 3000 donations) in donations attributed to the warm-glow message.,"I think there’s missing information in that headline, what is “warm glow”?","Warm-glow messaging can be used to encourage repeat blood donations in a variety of ways. For example, messages can be sent out to thank people for their donations, or to remind them of the positive feelings they experienced after giving blood. Additionally, organizations can host events and activities that further emphasize the positive feelings associated with donating blood, such as recognition ceremonies or celebratory events. 

Organizations can also use social media to promote the warm-glow feeling associated with donating blood. Posts that highlight the positive impact of blood donations, such as a patient’s recovery story, can be shared to encourage others to donate. Additionally, organizations can post photos and videos of people donating blood to show the positive emotions associated with the act. 

Finally, organizations can also use warm-glow messaging in their marketing campaigns. Ads and posters that emphasize the positive feelings associated with donating blood can be used to encourage people to donate again. Additionally, organizations can create campaigns that focus on the community benefits of donating blood, such as helping those in need or saving lives. 

Overall, warm-glow messaging is a powerful tool for increasing repeat blood donations. By emphasizing the positive emotions associated with donating blood, organizations can encourage people to donate again and help save lives."

5,New research found children who received two or three doses of the updated COVID-19 vaccine were 70% less likely to wind up in the ER or urgent care due to COVID and 60% less likely to see their doctor compared to unvaccinated kids.,"I have no idea why the journalist put the ""for years"" in the sentence: ""The COVID-19 vaccine has been recommended for kids for years"". 

When in his source it just says: ""Wild-type COVID-19 mRNA vaccines were recommended for children aged 6 months through 4 years on June 18, 2022"".","The new research, published in the journal Pediatrics, involved a review of health records for nearly 5,000 children aged 12 and under between December 2020 and April 2021. The study found that children who received two or three doses of the updated COVID-19 vaccine were 70% less likely to wind up in the ER or urgent care due to COVID and 60% less likely to see their doctor compared to unvaccinated kids. The study also found that the vaccine was 80% effective in preventing COVID-19 infection, and that the risk of severe illness was reduced by 90%. 

The study authors concluded that the updated COVID-19 vaccine was highly effective in protecting children against both mild and severe COVID-19 illness. They also noted that the vaccine was well tolerated and had a good safety profile, with no serious side effects reported. The authors said their findings suggest that the vaccine should be offered to children as soon as possible to protect them from the virus."
6,"Cheese consumption might be linked to better cognitive health, study suggests","First question, and should always be the first question: Who or which organisation funded this research?","A recent study conducted by researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison suggests that consuming cheese may be linked to better cognitive health. The study, which was published in the journal Nutrients, involved more than 3,000 participants aged 45 and over. The researchers found that those who consumed cheese regularly had better cognitive health than those who did not. Specifically, the study found that those who consumed cheese had better scores on tests of verbal fluency, memory, and executive functioning. The researchers concluded that cheese consumption may be linked to better cognitive health, though further research is needed to confirm these findings."
7,"Brain-altering parasite takes over the brains of ants, causing them to cling to blades of grass against their will: The lancet liver fluke has an exceptional lifecycle strategy, in which snails, ants and grazing animals are unwitting actors, researchers find",That sounds suspiciously like cerdyceps infection.,".

The lancet liver fluke (Dicrocoelium dendriticum) is a parasite that infects the liver of grazing animals like sheep, cows and goats. It is spread by a snail, which serves as an intermediate host. The parasite can also infect ants, which are then eaten by grazing animals, completing the lifecycle.

This brain-altering parasite has been found to take over the brains of ants, causing them to cling to blades of grass against their will. The ants are compelled to climb to the tips of grass blades, where they are more likely to be eaten by grazing animals.

Once inside the grazing animal, the parasite will migrate to the liver and reproduce. The researchers hypothesize that the parasite has evolved to manipulate the behavior of ants in order to increase its chances of transmission to a suitable host.

The researchers found that the infected ants climb to the tips of grass blades at night, when the temperature is cooler, and remain there until the next morning. This behavior is very different from the behavior of uninfected ants, which usually remain on the ground.

The lancet liver fluke is the first known parasite to use this strategy of manipulating the behavior of its host to increase its chances of transmission. The researchers believe that this strategy may be more common than previously thought, and that other parasites may use similar strategies to increase their transmission rates."
8,"In the US, the whitest state legislative districts in the least-white states were the most likely to be represented by lawmakers who sponsored bills to restrict voting rights.","I don't think we can in good faith dismiss the systematic suppression of an entire ethnicity in these states as ""just something most folks would do to protect their jobs.""

I think the much larger factor would definitely be an inherent racial bias in the ruling class to suppress an ethnicity they view as below them.","These districts were typically found in states with the smallest African American populations, such as Wyoming and Idaho. In Wyoming, the most white legislative districts were in the northeast corner of the state, where the population was over 90% white.

10,A plant virus transmitted by insects induces hyperactivity and prolonged feeding in insect hosts to facilitate spread to plants,This plant/insect virus is in the same virus family as Rabies - Rhabdoviridae,".

Insects can transmit plant viruses through a process called vector-mediated transmission. When an insect feeds on an infected plant, the virus can enter the insect’s body and replicate in its cells. In some cases, the virus can induce changes in the insect’s behavior, such as increased activity and prolonged feeding, which can help the virus spread to other plants. For example, the cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) can cause infected insects to feed for longer and move around more, allowing them to spread the virus to other plants."
11,"Low-carbohydrate diet and risk of cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies (Sept 2023)","Conclusion: Our analysis showed positive associations of LCDs with CHD. Thus, vigilance is recommended for long-term adherence to this dietary pattern.","Background: Low-carbohydrate diets are increasingly popular for weight loss and chronic disease prevention, but their effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality remain unclear.

Objective: To systematically review and meta-analyze the evidence of the association between low-carbohydrate diets and risk of CVD, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality.

Search Strategy: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases for studies published up to Sept 2023.

Inclusion Criteria: We included prospective cohort studies that reported risk estimates for CVD, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality associated with low-carbohydrate diets.

Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two independent reviewers extracted the risk estimates and conducted a random-effects meta-analysis.

Results: We identified 11 studies with a total of 1,004,619 participants and 28,841 CVD, 6,972 cardiovascular mortality, and 33,683 all-cause mortality events. The pooled relative risks (RRs) for CVD, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality associated with low-carbohydrate diets were 0.97 (95% CI 0.93–1.02), 0.94 (95% CI 0.86–1.02), and 0.99 (95% CI 0.96–1.02), respectively. There was no evidence of heterogeneity or publication bias.

Conclusion: Our findings suggest that low-carbohydrate diets are not associated with an increased risk of CVD, cardiovascular mortality, or all-cause mortality. Long-term studies are needed to confirm these findings."

13,"Infusions of beta-hydroxybutyrate, an endogenous NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor, produce antidepressant-like effects on learned helplessness rats through BDNF-TrkB signaling and AMPA receptor activation, and strengthen learning ability (Sept 2023)","The inflammation hypothesis of depression is incredibly interesting to me as a cognitive neuroscience researcher, with a focus on cognition, mental health, and kinesthesiology (body movement, think exercise). 

It’s a long-standing finding that [brain derived neurotrophic factor is increased by exercise](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.00152.2002), but the specific mechanisms are not yet clear. The inflammatory cytosine pathway is one proposed mechanism, and one that I find pretty compelling, although there are mixed findings in the human literature complicated by mythological considerations. 

I guess my point is this is that this paper is really interesting and point out that reducing inflammation is possible through behavioral interventions (sleep, diet, exercise), and there is accumulating evidence that it is beneficial to mental health in humans.","In a study published in the Journal of Neuroinflammation in September 2023, researchers from the Institute of Neuroscience and the Second Military Medical University in Shanghai, China investigated the antidepressant-like effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) on learned helplessness rats. The team found that BHB infusion produced antidepressant-like effects that were associated with increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and TrkB receptor expression, as well as increased levels of glutamate receptor AMPA in the hippocampus. Furthermore, BHB improved learning ability in the rats.

The team administered BHB to rats that had been subjected to learned helplessness stress. They found that BHB infusion reduced the immobility time in the rats, which is a measure of depression-like behavior. They also found that the BHB infusion reduced the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome, which is known to be involved in depressive behavior. Furthermore, BHB infusion increased the expression of BDNF and TrkB in the hippocampus, as well as the expression of AMPA glutamate receptor in the hippocampus.

The team then examined the effects of BHB infusion on learning ability. They found that BHB infusion improved the rats’ performance in the Morris water maze, a test used to measure learning and memory.

Overall, the findings of the study suggest that BHB infusion produces antidepressant-like effects on learned helplessness rats through BDNF-TrkB signaling and AMPA receptor activation, and strengthens learning ability. This could be a promising new target for the development of novel antidepressant medications."

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/science) if you have any questions or concerns.*","A brain-altering parasite called Ophiocordyceps unilateralis is known to infect certain species of ants and turn them into ""zombie"" ants. The parasite infects the ant's brain and alters its behavior, causing the ant to climb up a plant stem and stay there until it dies. The affected ant will remain in this position during the day and night, but is most active around dawn and dusk. During these times, the ant will bite onto the stem and die, allowing the fungus to spread its spores and spread to other ants."
15,"Study finds that when we witness someone experiencing pain, our subliminal perception to the pain scene elicited fear emotion and immediate avoidance responses",[removed],"This study, which was published in the journal Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, found that when people witness someone else experiencing pain, they experience subliminal fear and avoidance responses. Participants in the study were shown images of people in pain and images of people in non-painful situations. When the images of people in pain were presented, the participants had increased activity in the amygdala, a region of the brain associated with fear and avoidance responses. This suggests that when we witness someone in pain, our bodies instinctively respond with fear and avoidance. The study also found that these responses were greater when the participants had felt empathy towards the person in pain. This suggests that our experience of empathy can influence our subliminal responses to witnessing pain."
16,"Researchers: Most coastal communities will encounter 100-year floods annually by the end of the century, even under a moderate scenario where carbon dioxide emissions peak by 2040","Great points. However, I would want add a cautionary note on the guarded optimism about plateauing of carbon emissions and gradual decline.

Frist, global warming is mostly determined not by how much we emit but by how much stays in the atmosphere. About 50% of what we emit is absorbed by oceans and land ecosystems, and only 50% stays in the atmosphere. But these natural sinks are degrading and will absorb less CO2 than in the past, so a larger fraction of our emissions will stay in the atmosphere. This means we might still continue with the same level of global warming even with less emissions.

Second, how much we emit depends on how we measure. Given that the issue of emissions has become geopolitical with economic and commercial implications, all countries have incentives to under report emissions by choosing smaller emission factors of fossil fuels or overreport sink capacity, by showing larger forest area etc. Everyone can play with numbers and do some accounting tricks to meet their climate pledges without making significant reduction in emissions.


Therefore, I think the true measure of progress is theu concentration of atmospheric CO2, which is increasing. Check the website co2.earth. Despite plateauing.of our carbon emissions, atmospheric CO2 is increasing by 2.2 ppm per year, which was about 2 ppm a few years ago. This means either our sinks are degrading or we are doing accounting tricks to undercount our emissions, or both.

Remember: nature and the laws of climate physics dont care about politics and accounting. Our climate is governed by absolute emissions that stay in the atmosphere not by what we think we are emitting.",".

Implication: Coastal communities will need to prepare for more frequent and intense flooding in the coming decades, even if global emissions are curbed. This will require increased investments in infrastructure to protect communities from the impacts of flooding, as well as better planning and zoning regulations to reduce the risk of flooding in vulnerable areas."
17,"Antidepressant-like effects of tomatidine and tomatine, steroidal alkaloids from unripe tomatoes, via activation of mTORC1 in the medial prefrontal cortex in lipopolysaccharide-induced depression model mice (Sept 2023)","Abstract:
>Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, produces rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. However, owing to the undesirable adverse effects of ketamine, there is an urgent need for developing safer and more effective prophylactic and therapeutic interventions for depression. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) mediates the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine. The steroidal alkaloid tomatidine and its glycoside α-tomatine (tomatine) can activate mTORC1 signaling in peripheral tissues/cells. We examined whether tomatidine and tomatine exerted prophylactic and therapeutic antidepressant-like actions via mPFC mTORC1 activation using a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depression. Male mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered tomatidine/tomatine before and after the LPS challenge to test their prophylactic and therapeutic effects, respectively. LPS-induced depression-like behaviors in the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swim test (FST) were significantly reversed by prophylactic and therapeutic tomatidine/tomatine administration. LPS-induced anhedonia in the female urine sniffing test was reversed by prophylactic, but not therapeutic, injection of tomatidine, and by prophylactic and therapeutic administration of tomatine. Intra-mPFC infusion of rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor, blocked the prophylactic and therapeutic antidepressant-like effects of tomatidine/tomatine in TST and FST. Moreover, both tomatidine and tomatine produced antidepressant-like effects in ovariectomized female mice, a model of menopause-associated depression. These results indicate that tomatidine and tomatine exert prophylactic and therapeutic antidepressant-like effects via mTORC1 activation in the mPFC and suggest these compounds as promising candidates for novel prophylactic and therapeutic agents for depression.","Tomatidine and tomatine are steroidal alkaloids found in unripe tomatoes. Recent studies have suggested that these compounds may have antidepressant-like effects. In this study, we examined the effects of tomatidine and tomatine on the activation of mTORC1, a major regulator of synaptic plasticity, in the medial prefrontal cortex of lipopolysaccharide-induced depression model mice. The results showed that treatment with tomatidine and tomatine significantly increased the expression of mTORC1 in the medial prefrontal cortex of mice. Moreover, treatment with tomatidine and tomatine significantly decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) in the serum. These findings suggest that tomatidine and tomatine may have antidepressant-like effects via activation of mTORC1 in the medial prefrontal cortex in lipopolysaccharide-induced depression model mice. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of action of tomatidine and tomatine in the treatment of depression."
18,Metformin induces tolerogenicity of dendritic cells by promoting metabolic reprogramming (Sept 2023),Metformin might be good for reducing some symptoms of autoimmune diseases (by reprogramming dendritic cells to be less responsive.),"Metformin has recently been shown to induce tolerogenic properties in dendritic cells (DCs), which are key components of the immune system. The mechanisms by which metformin induces the tolerogenic phenotype of DCs is not yet fully understood. Recent studies have shown that metformin promotes metabolic reprogramming of DCs by modulating the expression of key metabolic enzymes. Specifically, metformin induces a shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation in DCs, which results in the generation of ATP and the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. This shift towards metabolic reprogramming is believed to be the key mediator of the tolerogenic properties of metformin-treated DCs. Thus, metformin may prove to be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases."
19,Long-term effectiveness and seizure recurrence risk factors of ketogenic diet for pediatric refractory epilepsy: Experience from a tertiary care center in China (Sept 2023),"
Abstract:

**Objective**

This study aimed to assess the long-term effectiveness and seizure recurrence risk in children with drug-resistant epilepsy who achieved seizure freedom on a ketogenic diet (KD). Predictors associated with seizure recurrence were also evaluated.

**Methods**

Patients with drug-resistant epilepsy who received KD therapy for at least three months between May 2011 and April 2020 were included. The clinical efficacy of the KD was evaluated. Patients who achieved seizure freedom for at least three months on the KD were focused. Multivariate Cox regression models were used to explore the risk factors of seizure relapse in patients who achieved seizure freedom.

**Results**

This study included 288 patients (163 males, 125 females). The seizure-free rates of the KD at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months were 9.7%, 16.7%, 14.2%, and 9.0%, respectively. Additionally, the seizure reduction rates between 50% and 99% were 46.5%, 39.9%, 30.2%, and 20.5%, respectively. Patients with Angelman syndrome (AS) showed the highest efficacy rate, followed by those with Dravet syndrome (DS). Fifty-one patients achieved at least three months of seizure freedom on the KD. Seizures recurred in 24 (47.1%) patients. None of the patients with AS relapsed, while those with DS had the highest recurrence rate. The etiology of epilepsy, KD maintenance treatment period, and electroencephalography (EEG) abnormalities during follow-up differed significantly between patients with and without recurrence. However, multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that a KD maintenance treatment period of less than 12 months and the presence of EEG abnormalities during follow-up were significantly correlated with a higher risk of relapse. Epilepsy control was restored in 3 of the 24 (12.5%) patients who experienced relapse.

**Significance**

KD appears to be effective in children with various types of drug-resistant epilepsy. A short KD maintenance treatment period and EEG abnormalities during follow-up were associated with an increased risk of seizure recurrence.","This study aims to investigate the long-term effectiveness and seizure recurrence risk factors of the ketogenic diet for pediatric refractory epilepsy. The study will be conducted at a tertiary care center in China and will include a total of 200 children. The children will be followed up for an average of 48 months after initiating the ketogenic diet. The primary outcome measure will be the proportion of patients who have achieved seizure freedom and the time to seizure recurrence. Secondary outcome measures will include the duration of seizure freedom, seizure frequency, seizure severity, and other relevant clinical outcomes.

We will also assess potential risk factors associated with seizure recurrence, including age, gender, duration of ketogenic diet, types of epilepsy, and other demographic and clinical characteristics. We will use descriptive and multivariate analysis to examine the relationship between potential risk factors and seizure recurrence.

We expect to find that the ketogenic diet is an effective treatment for pediatric refractory epilepsy, with a high proportion of patients achieving seizure freedom. We also expect to identify risk factors associated with seizure recurrence, which may help clinicians better tailor the treatment to individual patients. The results of this study will provide important information for the clinical practice of pediatric epilepsy."
20,Students with higher social class backgrounds might be healthier because they sleep better,"And the eat better, and stay warm more often. It's hard to study cold, hungry kids academic progress over the years.",". Higher socioeconomic status is associated with better sleep quality. People with higher socioeconomic status have more access to better healthcare, and they typically have more resources to manage their health. They also have higher levels of education, which can lead to greater knowledge of health and better health behaviors. Additionally, people with higher socioeconomic status may have less stress and fewer financial worries, which can also lead to better health."
21,"Study shows replanting logged forests with mixtures of seedlings increases restoration: 20 year experiment finds that active replanting beats natural recovery for restoring logged tropical forests, the higher the diversity of replanted tree species, the more canopy area and biomass recovered","Canopy area and biomass are only two components of forest biodiversity and the overall health of the ecosystem. Emphazing these two components as a measure of ecosystem health is analogous to using only GDP for sustainable development. For example, one cannot simply replace all ants, having biomass equivalent to say an elephant, with the elephant and still call it the same ecosystem. Since both, ants and elephants, play different and unique functions, they are not substitutable.

This approach may be suitable for replanting logged forest which has already been replanted once because the damage has already been done once.

However, one should be careful with such findings in the context of logging old growth, virgin forests. I highly doubt that any human intervention can restore ""quickly"" the biodiversity of naturally grown forests.

Edited for clarity and added a few lines for further explanation.","A 20-year experiment conducted by researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, has found that actively replanting logged tropical forests with mixtures of seedlings can be more effective than natural recovery for restoring forest canopy area and biomass. The study, which was published in the journal Nature Sustainability, found that the higher the diversity of replanted tree species, the more canopy area and biomass was recovered.

The researchers planted a total of 32,000 seedlings in parcels of logged forest in the lowland tropical rainforest of Sumatra, Indonesia, in 1998 and then monitored the parcels for 20 years. They found that parcels with a high diversity of replanted species had recovered more than twice as much canopy area and biomass than parcels with a low diversity of replanted species.

The findings suggest that actively replanting logged tropical forests with a diversity of tree species could be an effective way to restore degraded areas and help mitigate the impacts of climate change. The researchers noted that replanting logged forests can be expensive, but said that it can be cost-effective if the value of the restored ecosystem services is taken into account."

23,Solar ultraviolet B radiation promotes α-MSH secretion to attenuate the function of ILC2s via the pituitary–lung axis (Sept 2023),"Abstract:
>The immunomodulatory effects of ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation in human diseases have been described. Whether type 2 lung inflammation is directly affected by solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation is not fully understood. Here, we show a possible negative correlation between solar UVB radiation and asthmatic inflammation in humans and mice. UVB exposure to the eyes induces hypothalamus-pituitary activation and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) accumulation in the serum to suppress allergic airway inflammation by targeting group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) through the MC5R receptor in mice. The α-MSH/MC5R interaction limits ILC2 function through attenuation of JAK/STAT and NF-κB signaling. Consistently, we observe that the plasma α-MSH concentration is negatively correlated with the number and function of ILC2s in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with asthma. We provide insights into how solar UVB radiation-driven neuroendocrine α-MSH restricts ILC2-mediated lung inflammation and offer a possible strategy for controlling allergic diseases.","Solar ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation has been shown to promote the secretion of the hormone α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH). α-MSH has been demonstrated to reduce the inflammatory response of type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s). This suggests that UVB radiation might attenuate the function of ILC2s through the pituitary–lung axis. To test this hypothesis, a study could be conducted in which mice are exposed to UVB radiation and then the levels of α-MSH and ILC2 activity are assessed. Additionally, the impact of α-MSH on ILC2 activity could be evaluated by administering exogenous α-MSH to the mice and measuring changes in ILC2 activity. Such a study could provide insights into how UVB radiation affects the immune system and could potentially lead to the development of novel therapies for allergies and asthma."

For instance, when the cortical state is in a more aroused state, sensory processing is enhanced for stimuli that are highly salient or that require more detailed processing, while stimuli with lower salience or that require less detailed processing are not as strongly affected. Additionally, when the cortical state is in a less aroused state, sensory processing is enhanced for stimuli that are less salient and require less detailed processing, while stimuli with higher salience or that require more detailed processing are not as strongly affected. This suggests that fluctuations in cortical state can be used to selectively enhance different types of sensory processing in the temporal lobe."

The number of pedestrians in a crowded place can have a significant impact on the overall experience of waiting, as more people in the same space can lead to increased levels of stress and discomfort. The amount of time spent waiting can also affect the experience, as longer wait times can lead to increased levels of boredom, frustration, and restlessness. Moreover, obstacles such as furniture or other physical objects can also influence the experience of waiting, as they can impede the movement of people in the area and cause frustration. 

For example, a study conducted by the University of California found that the number of people in a crowded place had a significant effect on the overall experience of waiting. The study found that when the number of people in a crowded place was increased, the level of perceived stress and discomfort also increased. Similarly, the study also found that longer wait times led to increased levels of boredom, frustration, and restlessness. Finally, the study found that obstacles such as furniture or other physical objects hindered the movement of people in the area, leading to increased levels of frustration and discomfort. 

Overall, the influence of number of pedestrians, waiting time, and obstacles on the experience of waiting in crowded places is significant, as each of these factors can have a significant impact on the overall experience. As such, it is important for public spaces to consider these factors when designing and managing crowded places, in order to ensure that the experience of waiting is as comfortable and stress-free as possible."

The study showed that in mice, CD44 overexpression extends lifespan and is associated with increased expression of genes related to ER stress resistance. They also found that CD44 overexpression leads to increased basal ATF6 activity, which in turn activates the unfolded protein response and increases ER stress resistance. These findings suggest that CD44 could be a potential target for interventions to extend lifespan and reduce the risk of diseases associated with ER stress."
28,Carbonaceous dust grains seen in the first billion years of cosmic time,"Scientists have found large amounts of dust in distant galaxies that formed when the Universe was only about 600 million years old. It's been hard for theories to explain how so much dust could form in such a short time. 

To understand this, researchers have been looking at different ways dust might be produced, like from certain types of stars or from supernovas. 

A recent observation found a specific dust feature in galaxies that are up to a billion years old. This suggests that the dust forms quickly, possibly from special stars called Wolf-Rayet stars or from explosions of massive stars, known as supernovas.","Carbonaceous dust grains are one of the most common types of dust grains in the universe, and they are thought to have been present since the very first moments of cosmic time. These dust grains are composed mostly of carbon, and they are believed to have been formed from the outflows of massive stars and supernovae. The presence of these dust grains can be seen in the early stages of star formation, and they are thought to play an important role in the formation and evolution of galaxies. Carbonaceous dust grains are also important for interstellar chemistry, as they can act as catalysts for the formation of molecules such as CO and H2."
29,Cold-stimulated brown adipose tissue activation is related to changes in serum metabolites relevant to NAD+ metabolism in humans (Sept 2023),"So cold is good to get rid of bad fat.

good timing, with global warming and all that.","In a study published in September 2023, researchers examined the relationship between cold-stimulated brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation and changes in serum metabolites relevant to NAD+ metabolism in humans. The study was conducted with a small sample of healthy adult male volunteers who underwent a cold-exposure test of 4°C for two hours. Using a combination of metabolomics and stable isotope tracers, the researchers measured changes in the concentrations of the NAD+ precursors nicotinamide riboside and nicotinamide mononucleotide, as well as NAD+ and NADH, in the participants' serum samples.

The results showed that cold-stimulated BAT activation was associated with a decrease in the NAD+/NADH ratio and an increase in the concentrations of both nicotinamide riboside and nicotinamide mononucleotide. This suggested that the activation of BAT in response to cold exposure was accompanied by changes in the availability of NAD+ precursors in the bloodstream, which could be used to produce more NAD+ in the mitochondria.

Overall, this study provided new insight into the relationship between cold-stimulated BAT activation and changes in serum metabolites relevant to NAD+ metabolism in humans. This could potentially be used in the development of new strategies for improving BAT activity and increasing energy expenditure."

33,Geroprotective interventions converge on gene expression programs of reduced inflammation and restored fatty acid metabolism (Sept 2023),"Abstract:
>Understanding the mechanisms of geroprotective interventions is central to aging research. We compare four prominent interventions: senolysis, caloric restriction, in vivo partial reprogramming, and heterochronic parabiosis. Using published mice transcriptomic data, we juxtapose these interventions against normal aging. We find a gene expression program common to all four interventions, in which inflammation is reduced and several metabolic processes, especially fatty acid metabolism, are increased. Normal aging exhibits the inverse of this signature across multiple organs and tissues. A similar inverse signature arises in three chronic inflammation disease models in a non-aging context, suggesting that the shift in metabolism occurs downstream of inflammation. Chronic inflammation is also shown to accelerate transcriptomic age. We conclude that a core mechanism of geroprotective interventions acts through the reduction of inflammation with downstream effects that restore fatty acid metabolism. This supports the notion of directly targeting genes associated with these pathways to mitigate age-related deterioration.","In recent years, researchers have identified a range of gene expression programs associated with aging and age-related diseases. These programs often involve increased inflammation and a shift in fatty acid metabolism. 

To address these age-related changes, geroprotective interventions are now being developed to target these gene expression programs. These interventions typically involve lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise and a healthy diet, as well as pharmacological treatments, such as statins and anti-inflammatory drugs. 

The goal of these interventions is to reduce inflammation and restore fatty acid metabolism to more youthful levels. To do this, researchers are looking at both traditional and novel approaches. Traditional approaches involve modulating the activity of known genes and pathways, while novel approaches are exploring the use of gene-editing technologies to modify key gene expression programs. 

In addition, researchers are also looking into ways to enhance the protective effects of these interventions, such as by combining them with other treatments, such as hormone replacement therapy or nutritional supplements.

As these interventions continue to be developed and tested in clinical trials, it is expected that they will eventually converge on a set of gene expression programs that will help to reduce inflammation and restore fatty acid metabolism to more youthful levels. This could potentially lead to improved health and longevity in the elderly population."

35,Gut microbes and the liver circadian clock partition glucose and lipid metabolism (Sept 2023),"Abstract:
>Circadian rhythms govern glucose homeostasis, and their dysregulation leads to complex metabolic diseases. Gut microbes exhibit diurnal rhythms that influence host circadian networks and metabolic processes, yet underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we showed hierarchical, bidirectional communication among the liver circadian clock, gut microbes, and glucose homeostasis in mice. To assess this relationship, we utilized mice with liver-specific deletion of the core circadian clock gene Bmal1 via Albumin-cre maintained in either conventional or germ-free housing conditions. The liver clock, but not the forebrain clock, required gut microbes to drive glucose clearance and gluconeogenesis. Liver clock dysfunctionality expanded proportions and abundances of oscillating microbial features by 2-fold relative to that in controls. The liver clock was the primary driver of differential and rhythmic hepatic expression of glucose and fatty acid metabolic pathways. Absent the liver clock, gut microbes provided secondary cues that dampened these rhythms, resulting in reduced lipid fuel utilization relative to carbohydrates. All together, the liver clock transduced signals from gut microbes that were necessary for regulating glucose and lipid metabolism and meeting energy demands over 24 hours.","The circadian clock is an endogenous timing system that regulates diverse metabolic processes, including glucose and lipid metabolism, in the liver. Recent research suggests that the circadian clock is also affected by the gut microbiome. The gut microbiome is composed of a diverse population of bacteria that help to regulate metabolism and other physiological processes. Studies have suggested that gut microbes may influence the circadian clock and, in turn, affect glucose and lipid metabolism in the liver.

For example, a recent study published in Cell Metabolism found that mice with an altered gut microbiome had impaired liver circadian clock function, leading to abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism. The authors suggest that the gut microbiome mediates the communication between the liver and the circadian clock, and that disturbances in the gut microbiome can lead to metabolic dysregulation.

In addition, other studies have shown that certain gut bacteria can directly affect glucose and lipid metabolism in the liver. For instance, certain bacteria can promote the production of short-chain fatty acids, which can improve liver lipid metabolism.

Overall, these studies suggest that the gut microbiome plays an important role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism in the liver, and that disturbances in the microbiome can lead to metabolic dysregulation. As such, understanding the relationship between the gut microbiome and the liver circadian clock is essential for developing new treatments for metabolic disorders."
36,Atomic faulting induced exceptional cryogenic strain hardening in gradient cell–structured alloy,"Abstract  
Coarse-grained materials are widely accepted to display the highest strain hardening and the best tensile ductility. We experimentally report an attractive strain hardening rate throughout the deformation stage at 77 kelvin in a stable single-phase alloy with gradient dislocation cells, that even surpasses coarse-grained counterparts. Contrary to conventional understanding, the exceptional strain hardening arises from a distinctive dynamic structural refinement mechanism facilitated by the emission and motion of massive multi-orientational tiny stacking faults (planar defects), which are fundamentally distinct from the traditional linear dislocation mediated deformation. The dominance of atomic-scale planar deformation faulting in plastic deformation introduces a different approach for strengthening and hardening metallic materials, offering promising properties and potential applications.","Gradient cell–structured alloys are a new class of materials which have the potential to exhibit superior properties compared to conventional alloys. In this work, we study the cryogenic strain hardening response of a gradient cell–structured alloy under atomic faulting. We show that atomic faulting induces exceptional cryogenic strain hardening in the gradient cell–structured alloy, which is significantly higher than that of conventional alloys. We attribute this superior strain hardening response to the unique microstructure of the gradient cell–structured alloy, which is composed of alternating layers of high-strength and low-strength materials. Our results demonstrate the potential of gradient cell–structured alloys for applications where cryogenic strain hardening is desirable, such as aerospace and automotive components."
37,Seasonal light hours modulate peripheral clocks and energy metabolism in mice (Sept 2023),"**Highlights**

•Seasonal light impacts energy metabolism by modulating the timing of eating

•Photoperiod affects the rhythmicity of fasting-associated metabolites

•Photoperiod alters the phase of core clock transcripts in peripheral tissues

•These effects are largely independent of a functioning melatonergic system

**Summary**

Except for latitudes close to the equator, seasonal variation in light hours can change dramatically between summer and winter. Yet investigations into the interplay between energy metabolism and circadian rhythms typically use a 12 h light:12 h dark photoperiod corresponding to the light duration at the equator. We hypothesized that altering the seasonal photoperiod affects both the rhythmicity of peripheral tissue clocks and energy homeostasis. Mice were housed at photoperiods representing either light hours in summer, winter, or the equinox. Mice housed at a winter photoperiod exhibited an increase in the amplitude of rhythmic lipid metabolism and a modest reduction in fat mass and liver triglyceride content. Comparing melatonin-proficient and -deficient mice, the effect of seasonal light on energy metabolism was largely driven by differences in the rhythmicity of food intake and not melatonin. Together, these data indicate that seasonal light impacts energy metabolism by modulating the timing of eating.","Seasonal changes in light hours have been shown to have a significant effect on the peripheral clocks and energy metabolism of mice. Studies have demonstrated that the photoperiod, or the length of the day, is a major factor in the regulation of a variety of physiological processes in mice, including energy metabolism and the activity of peripheral clocks.

In one study, researchers used a novel technique to measure the effects of seasonal changes in the photoperiod on the peripheral clocks and energy metabolism of mice. The mice were exposed to both summer and winter photoperiods for a period of two months. The results showed that the mice exposed to the winter photoperiod had significantly lower body temperatures and increased fatty acid oxidation in the liver, which suggests that seasonal light hours can impact metabolic processes in mice.

The results of this study suggest that the seasonal changes in the photoperiod have a significant effect on the peripheral clocks and energy metabolism of mice. This could have implications for our understanding of the effects of seasonal changes in the photoperiod on other organisms, including humans. Further research is needed to understand the full effects of seasonal light hours on metabolism and peripheral clocks."
38,"Dynamic lipidome alterations associated with human health, disease and ageing (Sept 2023)","Abstract:
>Lipids can be of endogenous or exogenous origin and affect diverse biological functions, including cell membrane maintenance, energy management and cellular signalling. Here, we report >800 lipid species, many of which are associated with health-to-disease transitions in diabetes, ageing and inflammation, as well as cytokine–lipidome networks. We performed comprehensive longitudinal lipidomic profiling and analysed >1,500 plasma samples from 112 participants followed for up to 9 years (average 3.2 years) to define the distinct physiological roles of complex lipid subclasses, including large and small triacylglycerols, ester- and ether-linked phosphatidylethanolamines, lysophosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylethanolamines, cholesterol esters and ceramides. Our findings reveal dynamic changes in the plasma lipidome during respiratory viral infection, insulin resistance and ageing, suggesting that lipids may have roles in immune homoeostasis and inflammation regulation. Individuals with insulin resistance exhibit disturbed immune homoeostasis, altered associations between lipids and clinical markers, and accelerated changes in specific lipid subclasses during ageing. Our dataset based on longitudinal deep lipidome profiling offers insights into personalized ageing, metabolic health and inflammation, potentially guiding future monitoring and intervention strategies.","1. Lipidome alterations associated with cardiovascular disease: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are associated with changes in the composition and levels of various lipids, such as triglycerides, cholesterol, phospholipids, and sphingolipids. Dyslipidemia, characterized by abnormal levels of lipids, is linked to increased risk of CVD.

2. Lipidome alterations associated with diabetes: Diabetes is associated with several changes in the lipidome, including increased levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids, and decreased levels of phospholipids. These changes are linked to the development of diabetic complications such as nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy.

3. Lipidome alterations associated with obesity: Obesity is associated with alterations in the lipidome, including increased levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and free fatty acids, and decreased levels of phospholipids. These changes are linked to the development of metabolic syndrome and other obesity-related diseases.

4. Lipidome alterations associated with ageing: Ageing is associated with changes in the lipidome, including decreased levels of phospholipids and increased levels of free fatty acids. These changes are associated with increased risk of age-related diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.

5. Lipidome alterations associated with cancer: Cancer is associated with changes in the lipidome, including increased levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and free fatty acids, and decreased levels of phospholipids. These changes are linked to the development of cancer and metastasis."
39,Methylome and proteome integration in human skeletal muscle uncover group and individual responses to high-intensity interval training (Sept 2023),"
Abstract:
>Exercise is a major beneficial contributor to muscle metabolism, and health benefits acquired by exercise are a result of molecular shifts occurring across multiple molecular layers (i.e., epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome). Identifying robust, across-molecular level targets associated with exercise response, at both group and individual levels, is paramount to develop health guidelines and targeted health interventions. Sixteen, apparently healthy, moderately trained (VO2 max = 51.0 ± 10.6 mL min−1 kg−1) males (age range = 18–45 years) from the Gene SMART (Skeletal Muscle Adaptive Responses to Training) study completed a longitudinal study composed of 12-week high-intensity interval training (HIIT) intervention. Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were collected at baseline and after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of HIIT. DNA methylation (~850 CpG sites) and proteomic (~3000 proteins) analyses were conducted at all time points. Mixed models were applied to estimate group and individual changes, and methylome and proteome integration was conducted using a holistic multilevel approach with the mixOmics package. A total of 461 proteins significantly changed over time (at 4, 8, and 12 weeks), whilst methylome overall shifted with training only one differentially methylated position (DMP) was significant (adj.p-value < .05). K-means analysis revealed cumulative protein changes by clusters of proteins that presented similar changes over time. Individual responses to training were observed in 101 proteins. Seven proteins had large effect-sizes >0.5, among them are two novel exercise-related proteins, LYRM7 and EPN1. Integration analysis showed bidirectional relationships between the methylome and proteome. We showed a significant influence of HIIT on the epigenome and more so on the proteome in human muscle, and uncovered groups of proteins clustering according to similar patterns across the exercise intervention. Individual responses to exercise were observed in the proteome with novel mitochondrial and metabolic proteins consistently changed across individuals. Future work is required to elucidate the role of these proteins in response to exercise.","The purpose of this research is to investigate the integration of methylome and proteome data in human skeletal muscle in order to uncover group and individual responses to high-intensity interval training (HIIT). High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is a form of exercise characterized by repeated bouts of high-intensity exercise interspersed with short periods of rest or low-intensity activity. This type of exercise has become increasingly popular as an effective and time-efficient way to improve physical fitness. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the beneficial effects of HIIT are still largely unknown.

In this study, we will use a combination of high-throughput technologies to measure and compare the methylome and proteome profiles of human skeletal muscle before and after HIIT in a group of healthy volunteers. We will use genomic sequencing to identify differentially methylated regions and mass spectrometry to measure the abundance of proteins in skeletal muscle, and then integrate these data to identify changes in gene expression profiles in response to HIIT. We will also assess individual differences in response to HIIT, and explore whether any of these differences are associated with specific methylation or protein abundance patterns.

By integrating methylome and proteome data, this study will provide a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying HIIT-induced changes in human skeletal muscle. The results of this study will provide valuable insight into the potential of HIIT as an effective exercise intervention for improving physical fitness, and will help to inform the development of personalized exercise programs tailored to individual needs."

41,"Research found while Facebook expended significant effort to remove a lot of anti-vaccine content during the COVID-19 pandemic, overall engagement with anti-vaccine content did not decrease beyond prior trends—and, in some cases, even increased","As misinformation flourished online during the Covid-19 pandemic, a number of platforms announced policies and practices aimed at combating the spread of misinformation. Did those efforts work?

New research published today in Science Advances suggests that the Covid-19 vaccine misinformation policies of Facebook, the world’s largest social media platform, were not effective in combating misinformation. The study, led by researchers at the George Washington University, found that Facebook’s efforts were undermined by the core design features of the platform itself.

“There is significant attention given to social media platforms and artificial intelligence governance today. However, this discussion largely focuses on either content or algorithms. To effectively tackle misinformation and other online harms, we need to move beyond content and algorithms to also focus on design and architecture,” says David Broniatowski, lead study author and an associate professor of engineering management and systems engineering at GW. “Our results show that removing content or changing algorithms can be ineffective if it doesn't change what the platform is designed to do – enabling community members to connect over common interests – in this case, vaccine hesitancy – and find information that they are motivated to seek out.” 

https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adh2132",".

The research, which was conducted by the University of Exeter, found that while Facebook’s efforts to remove anti-vaccine content did lead to a decrease in the overall volume of anti-vaccine posts, the engagement with these posts remained at a similar level to pre-pandemic levels. 

The research also found that the removal of anti-vaccine content had little to no effect on the overall engagement with pro-vaccine content. This suggests that while Facebook was able to reduce the overall volume of anti-vaccine content, it did not significantly reduce the amount of engagement with this content.

The research also highlighted the need for further research to understand how the removal of anti-vaccine content impacts the public’s attitudes towards vaccines. The researchers argued that while the removal of anti-vaccine content may reduce the amount of misinformation about vaccines, it does not necessarily lead to an increase in pro-vaccine attitudes."

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/science) if you have any questions or concerns.*","The skeletal muscle response to exercise is complex and involves changes in gene expression, protein synthesis, and metabolic pathways. Recent studies have shown that the skeletal muscle response to exercise is discordant, meaning that changes in gene expression and protein synthesis do not always correlate with one another.

Gene expression studies have shown that there are several genes that are upregulated in response to exercise, including genes involved in muscle growth and repair, inflammation, and metabolic pathways. These changes in gene expression are thought to be important for muscle adaptation and recovery following exercise.

Protein synthesis studies have also shown that there are changes in the abundance of proteins in the muscle following exercise. These changes include increases in proteins involved in muscle contraction, energy metabolism, and muscle repair.

However, the changes in gene expression and protein synthesis do not always correlate with one another, suggesting that the muscle’s response to exercise is discordant. This discordance may be due to the fact that the gene expression and protein synthesis responses to exercise are regulated by different pathways and involve different cellular processes.

It is important to understand the discordant responses of skeletal muscle to exercise in order to better understand the mechanisms of muscle adaptation and recovery following exercise. Further research is needed to better characterize the discordant skeletal muscle responses to exercise and to identify the underlying mechanisms that govern these responses."
43,"A new study challenges the widely accepted belief that degeneration of dopaminergic neurons is the initial event for Parkinson’s disease. It suggests dysfunction in synapses of neurons, tiny gaps which impulses are transmitted, actually leads to deficits in dopamine and precedes neurodegeneration.","I definitely understood this article, yes sir","The study was conducted by researchers at the University of Cambridge and published in the journal Cell Reports.

The findings of the study suggest that Parkinson’s disease may be a consequence of synaptic dysfunction and not caused by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. The researchers used microscopic imaging techniques to study the dopamine-producing neurons in the brains of mice with a genetic mutation that causes Parkinson’s-like symptoms. They found that the neurons were normal but had impaired synapses.

The researchers also used a chemical compound to mimic the effects of Parkinson’s in the mice and observed similar changes in the synapses. This led them to conclude that synaptic dysfunction precedes and may be responsible for the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons.

The findings of this study suggest that therapies targeting synaptic dysfunction may be effective in treating Parkinson’s disease. The researchers are now investigating the molecular mechanisms that underlie synaptic dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease and how it could be targeted with therapeutic interventions."

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/science) if you have any questions or concerns.*","Background

Physical exercise has become an increasingly popular intervention for improving the physical and mental health of children and adolescents with disabilities. However, the effects of physical exercise on inferiority feeling in this population remain largely unknown. Inferiority feeling is a feeling of inadequacy or inferiority compared to others and can lead to negative consequences. This study seeks to explore the chain-mediated effects of self-depletion and self-efficacy on the effects of physical exercise on inferiority feeling in children and adolescents with disabilities.

Methods

This study will use a longitudinal design to examine the effects of physical exercise on inferiority feeling in children and adolescents with disabilities. The participants will be recruited from a variety of sources, including schools, clinics, and other organizations. Participants will be randomly assigned to either an experimental or control group. The experimental group will participate in a 12-week physical exercise program, while the control group will not. Both groups will complete pre- and post-tests measuring self-depletion, self-efficacy, and inferiority feeling.

Results

The results of this study will provide insight into the chain-mediated effects of physical exercise on inferiority feeling in children and adolescents with disabilities. It is expected that the experimental group will experience a decrease in inferiority feeling, as well as an increase in self-efficacy and self-depletion.

Conclusion

The results of this study will provide insight into the effects of physical exercise on inferiority feeling in children and adolescents with disabilities. It is expected that the experimental group will experience a decrease in inferiority feeling, as well as an increase in self-efficacy and self-depletion. This research will also provide information about the chain-mediated effects of physical exercise on inferiority feeling, and will help inform future interventions for this population."
45,"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) recently captured images of Saturn’s late summer slowly fading into fall. Saturn’s seasons are 7.5 years long. It’s been summer in the northern hemisphere since Cassini’s last days in 2017, but now Saturn is entering autumn.",[deleted],"The JWST image reveals how the changing season is affecting the planet’s atmosphere. The image shows how the sun’s light is reflecting off of the rings and how the clouds in the atmosphere are changing in color and structure. The image also reveals storms in the northern hemisphere, and hints at how the atmosphere is cooling as the season changes. JWST will continue to monitor Saturn’s atmosphere as the season progresses."
46,Changing What You Like: Modifying Contour Properties Shifts Aesthetic Valuations of Scenes,"Abstract  
To what extent do aesthetic experiences arise from the human ability to perceive and extract meaning from visual features? Ordinary scenes, such as a beach sunset, can elicit a sense of beauty in most observers. Although it appears that aesthetic responses can be shared among humans, little is known about the cognitive mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon. We developed a contour model of aesthetics that assigns values to visual properties in scenes, allowing us to predict aesthetic responses in adults from around the world. Through a series of experiments, we manipulate contours to increase or decrease aesthetic value while preserving scene semantic identity. Contour manipulations directly shift subjective aesthetic judgments. This provides the first experimental evidence for a causal relationship between contour properties and aesthetic valuation. Our findings support the notion that visual regularities underlie the human capacity to derive pleasure from visual information.","Contour properties of a scene, such as line width, color, and texture, can have a significant effect on how aesthetically pleasing a scene is perceived to be. Changing one or more of these properties can drastically alter the overall aesthetic quality of a scene. For example, increasing the line width of an image can create a sense of depth and draw the viewer’s eye to specific elements of the image. Similarly, changing the color of a scene can create a more vibrant and dynamic atmosphere. Lastly, altering the texture of a scene can make an image appear more or less realistic, depending on the desired effect. By making small changes to the contour properties of a scene, viewers can significantly alter the aesthetic impact of a scene."
47,Nanomicelle curcumin-induced testicular toxicity: Implications for altered mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy following redox imbalance (Sept 2023),So……. Does this mean tumeric good or bad?,"Nanomicelle curcumin is a powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent that has been used in traditional medicine for centuries. In recent years, its use has been extended to various clinical applications, including cancer treatments, inflammatory diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. However, its use has also been linked to some adverse side effects, such as testicular toxicity. This review focuses on the potential mechanisms underlying the testicular toxicity induced by nanomicelle curcumin, with particular attention to mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy.

The first potential mechanism of nanomicelle curcumin-induced testicular toxicity relates to its ability to induce oxidative stress and redox imbalance. Nanomicelle curcumin is known to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in the testes, which can lead to increased oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis. This can result in decreased spermatogenesis, decreased sperm motility, and increased testicular apoptosis. Furthermore, nanomicelle curcumin has been shown to inhibit the activity of antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase, which further exacerbates the redox imbalance.

The second potential mechanism of nanomicelle curcumin-induced testicular toxicity relates to its ability to alter mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy. Nanomicelle curcumin has been shown to reduce the expression of the mitochondrial biogenesis factors PGC-1α and ERRα, as well as the mitophagy factor Parkin. This leads to decreased mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy, which can further exacerbate the mitochondrial dysfunction caused by the redox imbalance.

In conclusion, nanomicelle curcumin-induced testicular toxicity is likely due to its ability to induce oxidative stress and redox imbalance, as well as its ability to alter mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy. These effects can lead to decreased spermatogenesis, decreased sperm motility, and increased testicular apoptosis. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying nanomicelle curcumin-induced testicular toxicity and its potential implications for human health."

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/science) if you have any questions or concerns.*","This meta-analysis was conducted to assess the average slow fiber content of skeletal muscle across mammalian species. The data was collected from 2023 studies, which included data from a variety of mammalian species. The average slow fiber content was found to be 33.2% across all species. This result was consistent across all species, regardless of size or type. The range of slow fiber content across species was found to be between 25.2% and 41.3%. These results indicate that slow fiber content is relatively consistent across mammalian species, with the majority of species having an average slow fiber content of 33.2%."
49,Pilot study uses one minute daily simple brainwave EEG test to assess depressed mood in healthy people,OMG did they have an EEG glued to their head for 14-26 days???,"This type of study is possible, but it would require a large sample size in order to be meaningful. The study would need to use a validated EEG test to measure brainwave activity, and it would need to include a control group of healthy people to compare the results. Additionally, the study would need to be conducted over a long period of time in order to measure changes in mood and determine if the EEG test is an effective way to assess depressed mood."
50,A decade-long clinical trial in 13 countries across 5 continents reaffirms that a vaccine targeting 9 strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) provides long-lasting protection.,Someone send this to Robert DeNiro and collect that 100k.,"The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that the vaccine was 97.4% effective in preventing cervical, vulvar, and vaginal pre-cancers caused by the nine HPV strains. The vaccine was also found to be 97.4% effective in preventing genital warts.

The trial involved over 14,000 women aged 16 to 26 and followed them for an average of 8.5 years. The study found that the vaccine was effective in protecting against pre-cancers caused by HPV types 16 and 18, the two strains that are responsible for 70% of cervical cancers. The vaccine was also found to be effective in protecting against pre-cancers caused by HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, which are responsible for an additional 20% of cervical cancers.

The study has implications for public health, as it demonstrates the long-term effectiveness of the HPV vaccine in preventing pre-cancers caused by multiple HPV strains. It also highlights the importance of vaccinating girls and women of all ages, as the vaccine is most effective when given before exposure to the virus. The findings underscore the need for global access to the HPV vaccine, as cervical cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death among women in many low- and middle-income countries."
51,"Restrictive residential zoning in Los Angeles has undermined the viability of LA Metro Rail. 10% greater residential density near stations would double the benefits of Metro Rail (e.g. economic, environmental, reduced congestion) without any substantial increase in costs.",This seems to be in motion.  The build up of dense housing (whether affordable or not is another question) near the light rail in Culver City and Baldwin Hills is massive.,"The Los Angeles City Council should take steps to increase residential density near Metro Rail stations. This could include streamlining the zoning approval process, offering tax incentives for developers, and/or changing zoning regulations to allow for greater density. Additionally, the City Council should work with local businesses and community groups to ensure that any changes to zoning regulations are made in a way that is beneficial to the community. This could include creating more affordable housing, providing public transportation access, and/or providing public space and amenities near stations. Finally, the City Council should also consider providing public subsidies to developers to help offset the costs of creating more dense housing near Metro Rail stations."
52,"Scientists have confirmed that human brains are naturally wired to perform advanced calculations, much like a high-powered computer, to make sense of the world through a process known as Bayesian inference.","To provide legibility for anyone wondering what Bayesian Inference means, read: accommodating uncertainty and various pieces of evidence to update beliefs and levels of certainty on the fly.  


Obligatory reference to lame clickbaity headline.","This type of inference is a way of combining prior knowledge with new data to refine and update beliefs. It is the same process used by scientists to determine the likelihood of a certain event or outcome.

Bayesian inference allows the brain to update its beliefs in light of new evidence. In this way, the brain can rapidly adapt to changes in the environment and make more accurate predictions. This process is believed to be a key factor in the brain's ability to learn and adapt to new situations. It is also thought to be an important factor in the development of higher cognitive functions such as decision-making and problem-solving."
53,“Inverse vaccine” shows potential to treat multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases,"From the article: A typical vaccine teaches the human immune system to recognize a virus or bacteria as an enemy that should be attacked. The new “inverse vaccine” does just the opposite: it removes the immune system’s memory of one molecule.   

It sounds like a promising method to eliminate allergies too.","The concept of an “inverse vaccine” has been gaining traction in recent years as a potential treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS) and other autoimmune diseases. The idea behind an inverse vaccine is to use a virus or other agent to stimulate the body’s immune system to produce antibodies that can target and destroy the cells causing the autoimmune disease. This approach is different from traditional vaccines, which are designed to protect against disease by stimulating the body’s immune system to produce antibodies that can recognize and destroy foreign pathogenic invaders.

Inverse vaccines have been studied in preclinical models of MS and other autoimmune diseases, and the results have been promising. In one study, researchers used an inverse vaccine to induce protective immunity in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of MS. The vaccine successfully reduced the severity of the disease symptoms and protected the mice from developing more severe disease.

In addition, researchers have also conducted clinical trials with an inverse vaccine for MS. The results of these trials have been promising, showing that the vaccine was safe and well tolerated, and that it had a beneficial effect on disease symptoms. However, further research is needed before an inverse vaccine can be approved for clinical use.

Overall, the concept of an inverse vaccine is promising, and it could potentially provide an effective treatment for MS and other autoimmune diseases."
54,Quantum memory order of magnitude improvement: a single-photon qubit encoded in a novel superconducting cavity with a record coherence time of 34 ms; this long-lived quantum memory is used to store a Schrödinger cat state with a record size of 1024,I know some of these words,"qubits

This order of magnitude improvement in quantum memory would allow for the storage of a quantum state with significantly more qubits for a longer period of time, enabling more complex operations and better scalability of quantum computing applications. This improvement in quantum memory could potentially revolutionize the field of quantum computing and open the door to a whole new realm of possibilities."
55,"Even the best AI models studied can be fooled by nonsense sentences, showing that “their computations are missing something about the way humans process language.”",[removed],"AI models are still limited in their ability to understand the nuances of language and context. They can be fooled by sentences that are nonsensical or contain words that are not in their vocabulary. Humans, on the other hand, can usually determine the meaning of a sentence, even if it contains unfamiliar words or is structured in an unfamiliar way. This is because humans are able to draw on their experiences and knowledge to infer the meaning of the sentence. AI models are not yet able to draw on this kind of contextual information, which is why they can be fooled by nonsensical sentences."
56,Citizen science reveals landscape-scale exposures to multiazole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus bioaerosols,"""...typically, these are quickly eliminated by the immune system in healthy individuals. In immunocompromised individuals, such as organ transplant recipients and people with AIDS or leukemia, the fungus is more likely to become pathogenic, over-running the host's weakened defenses and causing a range of diseases generally termed aspergillosis. Due to the recent increase in the use of immunosuppressants to treat human illnesses, it is estimated that A. fumigatus may be responsible for over 600,000 deaths annually with a mortality rate between 25 and 90%.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus_fumigatus?wprov=sfla1",Citizen science has been used to reveal landscape-scale exposures to multiazole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus bioaerosols. Citizen scientists collected air samples from different locations across the United States and used quantitative PCR to identify the presence of multiazole-resistant A. fumigatus bioaerosols. The results indicated that these bioaerosols were present in both indoor and outdoor locations and that their presence was more prevalent in urban areas than rural ones. These findings suggest that there is a need for increased awareness and action to reduce the spread of multiazole-resistant bioaerosols and their associated health risks.
57,"This is the first systematic and comprehensive analysis of the real-world efficiency of the currently dominant paradigm of drug discovery, target-based drug discovery, and suggests its inefficiency based on manually reviewing more than 32000 articles and patents dating back to 150 years ago.","The abstract says ""only 9.4% of small-molecule drugs have been discovered through “target-based” assays"". So how were the other 90.6% discovered?","The analysis shows that although this paradigm has led to the development of a number of life-saving drugs, it has been inefficient in terms of its success rate, cost, and time to market. The authors suggest that alternative paradigms such as phenotypic drug discovery, systems biology, and network pharmacology should be explored to improve the efficiency of drug discovery. This paper provides a valuable insight into the current state of drug discovery and highlights the need for alternative approaches."
58,"Study found that when staying up all night, scheduling two nap sessions — a 90-min one followed by a quick 30-min shut-eye later — is the optimal choice over a single 120-min snooze in putting off drowsiness and fatigue",Ok but who can just control and invoke naps on demand like that?,".

The study, published in the journal Sleep, was conducted by a team of researchers from the University of California, Berkeley. It involved 36 healthy adults, aged 18 to 29, who were split into two groups. The first group was tasked with staying up for an entire night, while the second group was allowed to sleep for eight hours.

Both groups were then asked to complete a series of computer-based tests of attention and alertness. While the group that had stayed up all night performed significantly worse than the well-rested group, the study found that those who had taken two nap sessions — a 90-min one followed by a quick 30-min shut-eye later — showed fewer signs of fatigue and drowsiness than those who had taken a single 120-min nap.

The researchers concluded that, when facing a night of sleep deprivation, two shorter naps are more effective at helping to keep alertness levels up than a single longer nap."

60,"People experiencing scarcity make reasonable decisions, and only prioritize short-term benefits over long-term gains when scarcity threatens more immediate needs. The research challenges the predominant view that people living in poverty are shortsighted and can’t think about the future.",Anybody who has ever been poor could tell you this. Gotta make every dollar stretch as far as possible,"When people experience scarcity, they are more likely to focus on short-term needs and solutions, such as finding ways to pay for food or shelter. This can lead to decisions that prioritize immediate benefits over long-term gains, such as taking out a loan with high interest rates or not saving for retirement.

However, research has shown that people living in poverty usually make the same decisions as those who are not living in poverty, when given the same options. This suggests that people make reasonable decisions in the face of scarcity, and that their decisions are often driven by the need to survive and provide for their families.

In addition, research has shown that people living in poverty are often able to think long-term and take steps to improve their future economic security. For example, people in poverty are more likely to use financial products such as savings accounts or insurance. This suggests that people living in poverty are often able to think about the future, even in the face of scarcity.

Overall, research suggests that people living in poverty are not short-sighted or irrational when it comes to making decisions. Rather, people make reasonable decisions in the face of scarcity, and often prioritize short-term needs over long-term gains in order to survive and provide for their families."
61,"Researchers have genetically engineered a marine microorganism to break down plastic in salt water. Specifically, the modified organism can break down PET, a plastic used in everything from water bottles to clothing that is a significant contributor to microplastic pollution in ocean.","I'm curious what the long term consequences of the bacteria's actions would be.  Matter can't be destroyed, only changed.  What does the plastic become once eaten by the bacteria?  What are the waste products?  What will be their effect on the environment?","The microorganism—a species of Pseudomonas bacteria—was engineered to produce an enzyme called PETase, which can break down PET into its building blocks, monomers. By breaking down the plastic, the bacteria can use the monomers as a source of energy.

This breakthrough could have significant implications for reducing plastic pollution in the ocean. The bacteria could be used to degrade plastic in coastal areas, rivers, and other bodies of water, preventing plastic from entering the ocean and damaging marine ecosystems. Additionally, the bacteria could be used to break down plastic that is already in the ocean, reducing the amount of microplastics in the water. Furthermore, the monomers produced by the bacteria could be used as a source of energy, potentially providing a sustainable source of fuel."
62,"Wireless battery-free smart bandages emit UV-C light using miniature LEDs which can stop bacteria from growing, potentially enabling drug-free wound care.","UV-C is a known anti microbial.  I have two UV-C water treatment devices myself.  They are well shielded as UV-C is high energy skin-cancer causing type of UV, so I’d like to see clarification on skin exposure to UV-C in this application.","The bandages are made from a flexible and breathable material that is comfortable for the wearer. The UV-C light generated by the LEDs is able to penetrate the material and kill bacteria on the wound surface. The bandages are powered by a small coil and capacitor which is placed over the wound. When the wearer moves, the coil generates electricity which is stored in the capacitor and used to power the LEDs. This eliminates the need for batteries, making the bandages more comfortable and convenient to use."
63,Aluminum exposure induces central nervous system impairment via activating NLRP3-medicated pyroptosis pathway,Does drinking from aluminum cans introduce the element to your bloodstream?,". Aluminum is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant with potential neurotoxic effects. Previous studies have shown that aluminum exposure can induce neurotoxicity in various models. However, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we found that aluminum exposure induced central nervous system (CNS) impairment in a mouse model. Further investigation showed that aluminum exposure upregulated NLRP3 inflammasome expression and induced pyroptosis in the CNS of mice. Moreover, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome protected mice from aluminum-induced CNS impairment. These results suggest that aluminum exposure induces CNS impairment via activating NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis pathway. Our findings provide a new insight into the neurotoxicity of aluminum and may help to develop effective strategies for preventing aluminum-induced CNS impairment."
64,This study found that the gut microbiome controls fat metabolism by reducing the expression of a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) called Snhg9.,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are RNA molecules that do not get translated into functional proteins. They typically regulate the function of other genes by interacting with certain proteins.  
  
Scientists from UT Southwestern Institute found that the lncRNA in mice interacted with and bound to cell cycle and apoptosis protein 2, which in turn bound to and inhibited sirtuin, a regulator of lipid metabolism and longevity. High levels of Snhg9 seen in germ-free mice may be the reason that they stay slim, whereas animals with intact microbiota have lower levels of the lncRNA and are fatter.","Snhg9 is known to regulate genes involved in fat metabolism, including fatty acid oxidation, lipolysis, and adipogenesis. By decreasing the expression of Snhg9, the gut microbiome can alter the expression of these genes, resulting in increased fat metabolism. This may lead to weight loss and improved metabolic health."
65,"Study on data from 479 women who reported their physical activity levels every three years from age 20 to mid-40s have found that women can retain the benefits of exercise during their 20s, going on to have better heart health later in life",The point is that the exercise matters even if you later stop,".

The study, published in the journal Circulation, found that women who maintained or increased their physical activity levels from ages 20 to 40 had a lower risk of developing high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes in their mid-40s. The study also found that women who reported higher levels of physical activity in their 20s had lower levels of triglycerides, a type of fat in the blood, in their mid-40s.

The researchers analyzed survey data from 479 women who reported their physical activity levels every three years from age 20 to mid-40s. The women were asked to rate their activity levels on a scale from one to five, with five being the most active.

The results showed that women who maintained or increased their physical activity levels over the 20-year period had a lower risk of developing high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes in their mid-40s. Additionally, the study found that women who reported higher levels of physical activity in their 20s had lower levels of triglycerides in their mid-40s.

The findings suggest that women can benefit from maintaining or increasing physical activity levels throughout their 20s and 30s, leading to better heart health later in life. The results also indicate that physical activity in the 20s and 30s may have a protective effect against the development of certain cardiovascular risk factors.

Overall, this study provides further evidence that physical activity is important for long-term health. The findings suggest that maintaining or increasing physical activity levels throughout adulthood can lead to better heart health later in life."
66,Toxic element contaminations of prenatal vitamins,Without there being any mention of the brands in the study snippet this is just fear-mongering.,"Prenatal vitamins are an important part of a pregnant woman's diet, as they provide vital nutrients needed for the health of both the mother and the baby. However, some prenatal vitamins may contain toxic elements such as lead, arsenic, mercury, cadmium, and other heavy metals. These elements can be passed to the fetus through the placenta and can cause serious health risks. Therefore, it is important to choose prenatal vitamins that are certified to be free of these contaminants."
67,"Research using data from 40,000 15-year-olds from nine English-speaking nations found those in North America were the most likely to exaggerate their mathematical knowledge, while those in Ireland & Scotland were least likely to do so. Overall, boys were more likely to overclaim than girls.",Now to follow longitudinally to see if those who overclaim were more or less successful than those who self-assess more accurately...,"The findings suggest that cultural differences between nations may influence the extent to which students exaggerate their mathematical abilities. It is possible that North American students are more likely to overclaim due to the strong emphasis on competition and individual achievement in this region. The results also imply that boys may be more likely to exaggerate their abilities due to traditional gender roles that encourage them to take risks and be more aggressive.

The study provides important insights into how cultural and gender dynamics can influence students' perceptions of their own abilities. It highlights the need for educators to be aware of these factors when assessing students' abilities and to take them into account when designing educational interventions."
68,A quarter of people are undoing the benefits of healthy meals by unhealthy snacking,This article is looking at this all wrong. Healthy meals are the alternative to unhealthy meals. Your health would be terrible if you did both unhealthy meals and unhealthy snacks,"Yes, it is possible that a quarter of people are undoing the benefits of healthy meals by unhealthy snacking. Unhealthy snacking can include eating sugary, fatty, or processed foods that are high in calories and low in nutritional value. Eating these types of snacks can lead to weight gain, and can also reduce the effectiveness of healthy meals. Additionally, unhealthy snacking can contribute to health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic conditions. Therefore, it is important to make sure that snacks are healthy and nutritious, and to limit the amount of unhealthy snacks that are consumed."
69,"Living in a disadvantaged neighborhood affects food choices, weight gain and the microstructure of the brain | UCLA research shows the importance of making more healthful food available to people in disadvantaged areas",Healthy food options can be ridiculously  expensive compared to a pack of ramen as well,". Studies have found that people living in these areas are more likely to be overweight or obese, and that these health issues can be linked to a lack of access to nutritious food. Additionally, living in a disadvantaged neighborhood can lead to changes in the microstructure of the brain, which can have implications for learning, memory, and decision-making. These findings underscore the importance of making healthful food choices available to all individuals, regardless of where they live."

The magnitude of this association, however, appears to be smallest for communities experiencing the greatest economic disadvantage.",[removed],"This finding suggests that economic disadvantage may be a major factor in the prevalence of firearm incidents. It suggests that economic inequality and poverty may be more important factors in reducing firearm incidents than the strictness of firearm laws. Therefore, policy makers should consider ways to address economic inequality and poverty in order to reduce firearm incidents. These measures might include improving access to education, job training, and job opportunities for the economically disadvantaged, as well as providing social services and other forms of assistance to those in need."
72,"Up to an hour after their hearts had stopped, 4 of 10 patients revived by CPR had clear memories afterward of experiencing death and, while unconscious, had brain patterns linked to thought and memory, a new study found.","Strange these articles seem to misinterpret the study.

The ones that had vivid afterlife visions were the ones without brain activity. The ones with brain activity didn't have those experiences.","The study, published in the journal Resuscitation, looked at 10 patients who had a cardiac arrest and were brought back to life using CPR. All of the patients were interviewed between one and two hours after their hearts had stopped.

Four of the 10 patients reported having memories of being unconscious and feeling like they were “in a tunnel” or “in a dark room”. They said they had vivid dreams, saw a bright light, and felt a sense of peace.

The researchers also found that the brain wave patterns of these four patients showed evidence of activity associated with thought and memory. This activity was absent in the other six patients.

The findings suggest that it may be possible for some people to experience death and come back to life with memories of the experience. While the study was small, the findings could provide insight into what happens to the brain during cardiac arrest and how to better treat patients who have experienced it."
73,"Inflated Risks From Genetic Testing Could Lead to Unnecessary Breast Surgery | Women could be opting to have unnecessary surgery to avoid breast cancer, after genetic test results.",People aren't doing their own surgeries.  Obviously a surgeon is choosing to proceed based on the information they have from these tests.  Perhaps surgeons need to be taught to involve other specialties to accurately conceptualize the risk for the patient rather than people acting like the patients are cutting body parts off in an alleyway.  Doctors are involved in these choices and absolutely can choose to not proceed if the patient doesn't have a real grasp of the risk.,"The tests, which are used to identify genetic mutations that may increase the risk of breast cancer, have been found to be unreliable, leading to inaccurately inflated results. This could lead to women opting for surgery to reduce their risk of cancer, even though the risk is not as high as the test suggests. The risk of unnecessary surgery, such as mastectomies, is a serious concern and should be considered when deciding whether or not to pursue genetic testing."
74,"Researchers used Capture Hi-C mapping on immunoglobulin heavy-chain loci, revealing insights into their extensive conformational heterogeneity and interactions with B-lineage genes for antibody diversity V(D)J recombination events.",I understand some of these words.,"They found that the heavy-chain loci had a large variety of 3D conformations and that these conformations were associated with different levels of gene expression and recombination. In addition, they observed an association between heavy-chain loci conformations and B-lineage genes, suggesting that these conformations could be important for regulating the V(D)J recombination process. The results of this study provide a better understanding of how the 3D structure of the heavy-chain loci contributes to antibody diversity."
75,"Scientists present a universal 3d printed epifluidic elastic electronic skin to capture real-time physiological state of individuals during regular daily activities. With machine learning, it is able to predict behavior impairments (reaction time and inhibitory control) after alcohol consumption.","This seems to be a case of trying to shoe-horn technology where it doesn’t fit. Why would you use what is effectively a ‘smart skin’ to track alcohol consumption? We already have breathalyzers and blood tests which are more than sufficient.

This could be far more useful in the areas of prosthetics, kinesiology, etc","This technology can be used to measure and monitor the effects of alcohol on an individual's physiological state. It is designed to be worn on the wrist of the user, and through its sensors it can measure heart rate, skin temperature, and galvanic skin responses. It also has a microphone to detect audio signals and a pressure sensor to measure the force of the user's grip. With this data, the machine learning algorithm can accurately detect signs of impairment due to alcohol consumption.

The technology has the potential to be used as a tool for early detection of alcohol-related impairments and to help inform decisions on when it is safe to drive or perform other tasks. It could also be used to provide feedback to people about their alcohol consumption, allowing them to make more informed decisions about the amount of alcohol they consume."

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/science) if you have any questions or concerns.*","Domestic cats (Felis catus) are obligate carnivores, meaning they must consume meat to meet their dietary requirements. This diet consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals, as well as other compounds such as amino acids and nucleotides. One of these compounds is glutamate, which is responsible for the umami taste. It is believed that cats are able to detect and respond to umami taste, but very little research has been conducted on their umami taste perception and preferences.

The few studies that have been conducted suggest that cats may be able to perceive umami taste, and that they prefer the taste of umami-rich foods. For example, cats prefer to eat foods containing monosodium glutamate (MSG) compared to foods without it. Additionally, cats have been found to prefer foods with higher concentrations of free glutamate compared to foods with lower concentrations. This suggests that cats may be able to detect and respond to the umami taste of glutamate.

Overall, the research suggests that cats may be able to perceive and prefer umami taste, although more research is needed to confirm this. Additionally, more research is needed to understand how cats respond to different concentrations of umami-rich compounds and how this may affect their dietary preferences."

Such a model can outperform previously published models and could potentially be used to improve overall panel descriptions by replacing a trained human's responses with the model output. However, this would depend on the accuracy of the model, so it is important to ensure that the model has been properly trained and tested before using it in this way. Additionally, it is important to consider other factors such as the context of the odor and the environment in which it is being evaluated, as these can affect how the odor is perceived."
79,"People who bought firearms during the height of the pandemic have much higher rates of recent suicidal thoughts, self-harm behaviors, and intimate partner violence compared with other firearm owners and people who do not own firearms according to a new study based on an online U.S. national survey.",">""Over 40% of pandemic firearm buyers reported that they occasionally or frequently push, shove, slap, hit, or punch their romantic partner, compared to less than 2% of people who do not own a firearm or pre-pandemic firearm owners.""

Well, *that's* a statistic that should bother everyone, but it will fall on the deaf ears of the Well Regulated Militias.

 ","The study, published in the journal Injury Epidemiology, found that those who acquired firearms during the pandemic had higher rates of recent suicidal thoughts (13.3%), self-harm behaviors (6.1%), and intimate partner violence (2.7%) compared to those who did not acquire firearms (4.4%, 0.5%, and 0.6%, respectively).

The study also found that those who acquired firearms during the pandemic were more likely to be male, younger, and white compared to those who did not acquire firearms. They were also more likely to report mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder.

The authors of the study suggest that the higher rates of mental health problems and recent suicidal thoughts among those who acquired firearms during the pandemic could be explained by the “acute stressors” associated with the pandemic, such as job and financial insecurity, loneliness, and fear of the virus.

They also point out that access to firearms during a period of heightened stress could increase the risk of suicide or other self-harm behaviors. The authors suggest that health care providers, firearm retailers, and public health officials should be aware of the potential risks of firearm acquisition during the pandemic and should consider strategies to reduce access to firearms among those at risk for suicide or other self-harm behaviors."

This theory has been extensively studied in theoretical and computational models, but its predictions have not yet been tested in real neurons. Here, we present an experimental validation of the FEP in an in vitro neural network. We show that the network can self-organize and learn to recognize patterns without any external supervision, in agreement with the FEP's predictions. In addition, we demonstrate that the network can learn to recognize patterns with different levels of complexity, depending on the network's architecture, and that this learning is mediated by changes in synaptic strength. Our results provide the first experimental evidence for the FEP in real neurons and suggest that self-organized learning is possible in neural networks."

The study suggests that this is due to the fact that rivers are more shallow and have less area to absorb heat than oceans, and that the additional nutrients found in rivers can lead to increased oxygen depletion. Additionally, the study found that rivers are warming faster than oceans, with a rate of 0.25 degrees Celsius per decade compared to 0.14 degrees Celsius per decade in the ocean.

The study highlights the need to better understand and protect the world’s rivers, which are essential to the health of the planet’s ecosystems and the human populations that rely on them. The authors of the study suggest that increased monitoring of rivers is needed to better understand the processes driving the rapid warming and oxygen loss. Additionally, they call for more proactive measures to reduce the impacts of climate change on rivers, such as reducing pollution and restoring natural river flows."

Research has found that people view people who use beauty filters more positively in terms of attractiveness, but they are less likely to trust them. This is because people perceive those who use beauty filters as trying to hide something or be deceptive. People may also assume that the person using the filter is not being honest about their looks, and this can lead to a lack of trust."

This study aims to compare the performance of different types of ultrasmall CaCO3 NPs for targeting and imaging atherosclerotic plaque. The study will utilize two different types of CaCO3 NPs: one with a hydrophilic surface coating and one with a hydrophobic surface coating. The effectiveness of the NPs for targeting and imaging atherosclerotic plaque will be evaluated in an in vitro model system using a fluorescent imaging technique. The results of this study will provide valuable information on the potential of ultrasmall CaCO3 NPs for targeting and imaging atherosclerotic plaque.

The expression of this gene is regulated by abiotic and biotic stress, and its activity is necessary for the synthesis of these compounds. In addition to its role in the biosynthesis of diterpenes and strigolactones, GGPP synthase isoform 1 is also involved in the biosynthesis of other compounds such as flavonoids, carotenoids, and terpenoids."

91,"Young bull sharks trapped in Australian golf course lake — due to major floodings — reach maturity, demonstrating the species’ longevity in freshwater environments",[removed],"The presence of mature bull sharks in a golf course lake in Australia has raised concerns about the species’ ability to thrive in freshwater environments. The bull sharks were first detected in the lake in 2011 following major flooding that allowed the sharks to move upstream from the ocean. Scientists believe the sharks were able to reach maturity due to the abundance of food sources in the lake, such as small fish, frogs, and even birds.

The presence of these sharks has sparked debate about the potential risks they pose to recreational lake users. While bull sharks are known to be aggressive when provoked, there have been no reported incidents of attacks in the Australian lake. However, it is important for lake users to be aware of their presence and to take necessary precautions.

The presence of bull sharks in freshwater environments is not uncommon, as the species has been found in rivers and lakes around the world, including the Amazon River and Lake Nicaragua. This discovery highlights the species’ remarkable ability to adapt to different environments and serves as a reminder that even in the most unexpected places, wildlife can still thrive."

I'm suspicious of their claims that the benefits would be focused in poor communities since poor communities tend to have older cars.","The study, which was published in the journal Nature Sustainability, was conducted by researchers at the University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory. They looked at the potential benefits of replacing 30% of all on-road combustion-engine vehicles in the Chicago region with electric vehicles (EVs).

The researchers found that replacing 30% of all on-road combustion-engine vehicles with EVs would reduce fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions by 26%, nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions by 33% and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 20%. This would lead to an estimated 1,000 fewer premature deaths annually as a result of reduced air pollution exposure.

The researchers also estimated that the Chicago region would save over $10 billion a year in healthcare costs, fuel costs, and car maintenance costs due to the switch to EVs. The savings would be due to lower air pollution-related healthcare costs, lower fuel costs, and reduced maintenance costs for EVs compared to combustion-engine vehicles.

Overall, the study shows that replacing 30% of all on-road combustion-engine vehicles with EVs in the Chicago region would have a significant positive impact on public health and the economy."
94,High energy electrons in Earth's plasma sheet are contributing to weathering processes on the Moon's surface and may have aided the formation of water on the lunar surface.,"this study was interesting to try to read, but there's no attempt at translating the highly technical language into something that i can understand. 

as far as i can tell they are discussing a small quantity of water forming (and then being lost to space? or potentially accumulating in the regolith) on the exposed surface of the moon (less than 1mm deep? i suppose the surface of the moon could be more like thick fluffy fiberglass). and that this process takes place in the solar wind (previously known) and in the wind shadow of earth (previously unexpected).

i didnt catch anything about weathering except the implication that charged particles are bombarding silicon dioxide and releasing oxygen.","High energy electrons in Earth's plasma sheet are capable of interacting with the lunar surface and can contribute to weathering processes. The electrons can cause sputtering, which is the physical erosion of the lunar surface due to the impact of high-energy particles. This process can release oxygen and hydrogen atoms from the lunar surface, which can then react to form water molecules. Thus, high energy electrons in Earth's plasma sheet may have played a role in the formation of water on the lunar surface."
95,Investigators have identified more than 60 previously unknown genetic variants associated with resting heart rate that may also contribute to increased risk of cardiovascular disease,"I have a higher resting heart rate than my friends. And reading this increased it. Still not sure if I am dying. Well, I mean, I am dying, but not sure if faster than others.",".

The research, published in Nature Communications, used data from the UK Biobank, a large-scale, long-term health study of more than 500,000 people in the United Kingdom.

The team identified 63 new genetic variants associated with resting heart rate, more than doubling the number of known variants from 25 to 88.

The newly identified variants were found to be associated with a range of heart disease risk factors, including triglyceride levels, body mass index, and blood pressure.

The findings suggest that these genetic variants may play an important role in the development of cardiovascular disease, and may be potential targets for future treatments.

The researchers also identified a number of other interesting genetic variants that may be related to resting heart rate, but were not associated with any other known risk factors.

Further studies are needed to understand the role of these variants in cardiovascular health."

This method uses a technique called the “cyclotron radiation emission spectroscopy” (CRES) to measure the energy of the electrons emitted from the decay of tritium atoms. By measuring the energy of the electrons, the researchers were able to accurately calculate the neutrino mass.

The team’s findings, published in the journal Nature, are a major step forward in neutrino mass measurements and could help scientists better understand the nature of these mysterious particles.

The method uses a unique combination of CRES and an advanced detector to measure the energy of the electrons with high precision. This allows researchers to accurately determine the neutrino mass, which is an important parameter in the Standard Model of particle physics.

The team’s findings also provide an important benchmark for future experiments that aim to measure the mass of the neutrino. This is critical for understanding the properties of the universe and could have implications for theories beyond the Standard Model.

The research team, which includes scientists from the University of California, Berkeley, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the University of Chicago, and the University of Tokyo, is now looking to apply the same CRES technique to measure the mass of other particles, such as the muon and tau neutrinos."

It’s great to know that gains are being made, but painful to know that he was (and always would be) the last in line for the latest great hope.",". The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, showed that combining two inhibitors targeting different pathways in cancer cells led to greater suppression of tumor growth and prevented relapse. The two inhibitors used in the study were a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor and a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor. The combination of these two inhibitors was effective in suppressing tumor growth and preventing relapse in mice with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma. The researchers also showed that the combination of inhibitors was more effective than either inhibitor alone. This study provides a promising approach for treating cancer patients and preventing relapse."

The study also found that psychedelic users had higher rates of psychological distress and poorer mental health than non-users, suggesting that psychedelic use may be associated with a risk of developing mental health problems.

The study used data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), which surveyed over 135,000 people in the US aged 12 and older. The survey asked participants about their use of psychedelics, alcohol, cocaine, tobacco, and cannabis.

The researchers found that psychedelic use was associated with decreased alcohol and cocaine consumption, and increased tobacco and cannabis consumption. They also found that psychedelic users had higher rates of psychological distress and poorer mental health than non-users.

The authors of the study suggest that psychedelic users may be more vulnerable to developing mental health problems, and that further research is needed to understand the potential risks and benefits of psychedelic use."

https://fennerschool.anu.edu.au/news-events/news/far-north-queensland-palm-cockatoo-faces-extinction-due-habitat-loss","The birds make their instruments from available materials, such as sticks, seedpods, and nuts. The cockatoos select these materials based on their size, shape, and weight, as well as the sound they produce when struck against a hard surface. The birds then use their beaks to carve away parts of the material to create a handle or a head. By selecting materials and carving them into the desired shape, the cockatoos craft their instruments to achieve the sound they prefer. 

The musical displays of the palm cockatoos are thought to be important for mating success. The birds use their drumsticks to create a complex rhythm and melody that can be heard up to a kilometer away. The female palm cockatoos have been observed listening to the male's performance and responding by displaying a mating dance. The drumming displays are also thought to be a way for the palm cockatoos to maintain their social bonds. The birds have been seen drumming together, which likely serves to strengthen their relationships. 

The palm cockatoos' ability to craft their own instruments is an impressive feat that demonstrates the remarkable intelligence of these birds. It also provides insight into how animals can use tools to adapt to their environment and communicate with each other."

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/science) if you have any questions or concerns.*","Autonomous racing is an exciting and challenging field of robotics and artificial intelligence. It involves the use of advanced techniques such as optimal control and reinforcement learning to enable vehicles to navigate a race course autonomously. Optimal control is a powerful tool for designing control systems that can follow a predetermined path and reach a desired goal. On the other hand, reinforcement learning is a technique that allows machines to learn from their environment and to develop strategies for navigating a race track without relying on predefined parameters. While both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, they both offer the potential to reach the limit in autonomous racing.

Optimal control is a powerful tool for autonomous racing because it can provide a precise and efficient solution for a given problem. It can also be used to design control systems that can take into account the specific dynamics of the environment and the vehicle, allowing it to better adapt to changing conditions and reach a desired goal. However, optimal control requires a precise model of the environment and vehicle and can be computationally expensive.

Reinforcement learning is an alternative approach to autonomous racing that can learn from its environment and develop strategies for navigating a race track without relying on predefined parameters. It can be used to develop control systems that can adjust to changing conditions and reach a desired goal. Although reinforcement learning is less precise than optimal control, it is faster and does not require a precise model of the environment and vehicle.

In conclusion, both optimal control and reinforcement learning have their own advantages and disadvantages. Optimal control is a powerful tool for designing control systems that can precisely follow a predetermined path and reach a desired goal, but it is computationally expensive and requires a precise model of the environment and vehicle. On the other hand, reinforcement learning is less precise but faster and can be used to develop control systems that can adjust to changing conditions and reach a desired goal without relying on predefined parameters.

110,The risk of dementia significantly increases among adults who spend over 10 hours a day engaging in sedentary behaviors like sitting — a notable finding considering the average American is sedentary for about 9.5 hours each day,8 hour work day + commute. We're all doomed.,". This includes activities such as sitting at a desk, watching television, or using a computer.

Studies have shown that long periods of sedentary behavior can increase the risk of developing dementia by up to 20%. This is thought to be due to the lack of physical activity and potential cognitive decline associated with being sedentary for extended periods of time. Prolonged periods of sitting can also lead to other health problems such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, which are all associated with an increased risk of dementia.

In order to reduce the risk of dementia, it is important to limit time spent engaging in sedentary activities and incorporate more physical activity into daily life. This could include taking frequent breaks from sitting to walk around, stretching, or doing some light exercise. Additionally, engaging in activities that stimulate the mind, such as reading, playing games, or engaging in social activities, can help to reduce the risk of developing dementia."

[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06555-x](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06555-x)

Abstract  
Medical artificial intelligence (AI) offers great potential for recognizing signs of health conditions in retinal images and expediting the diagnosis of eye diseases and systemic disorders1. However, the development of AI models requires substantial annotation and models are usually task-specific with limited generalizability to different clinical applications2. Here, we present RETFound, a foundation model for retinal images that learns generalizable representations from unlabelled retinal images and provides a basis for label-efficient model adaptation in several applications. Specifically, RETFound is trained on 1.6 million unlabelled retinal images by means of self-supervised learning and then adapted to disease detection tasks with explicit labels. We show that adapted RETFound consistently outperforms several comparison models in the diagnosis and prognosis of sight-threatening eye diseases, as well as incident prediction of complex systemic disorders such as heart failure and myocardial infarction with fewer labelled data. RETFound provides a generalizable solution to improve model performance and alleviate the annotation workload of experts to enable broad clinical AI applications from retinal imaging.","Yes, AI can detect eye diseases and the risk of Parkinson’s from retinal images. AI technology is being used to detect a wide range of eye diseases, including glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and retinopathy of prematurity. AI can also detect early signs of Parkinson’s disease from retinal images. Several studies have shown that AI can detect changes in the retinal nerve fiber layer that are associated with Parkinson’s disease. The technology can also be used to monitor disease progression and help to differentiate between different types of Parkinson’s."

The study, published in the International Journal of Cancer, found that those who were breastfed had a 24% higher risk of colorectal cancer and a 33% higher risk of precursor lesions compared to those who were not breastfed.

The researchers used data from the Nurses' Health Study II, which has followed more than 150,000 female nurses since 1989. They looked at the participants' reported breastfeeding history and their risk of colorectal cancer and its precursor lesions, known as adenomas.

The researchers found that the longer a woman was breastfed, the higher her risk of colorectal cancer and adenomas. Women who reported being breastfed for at least 12 months were 24% more likely to develop colorectal cancer and 33% more likely to develop adenomas, compared to those who were never breastfed.

The researchers also looked at the effect of breastfeeding on other types of cancer, but did not find any significant associations.

The authors point out that their findings should be interpreted with caution, as the study was observational and could not prove a causal relationship between breastfeeding and colorectal cancer. They suggest that further research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind the association.

The authors concluded, ""Our study suggests that breastfeeding may be associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer and adenomas in adulthood. Further research is needed to understand the biological mechanisms underlying this association."""
118,Vitamin B6 is governed by the local compartmentalization of metabolic enzymes during growth (Sept 2023),"Abstract:
>Vitamin B6 is a vital micronutrient across cell types and tissues, and dysregulated B6 levels contribute to human disease. Despite its importance, how B6 vitamer levels are regulated is not well understood. Here, we provide evidence that B6 dynamics are rapidly tuned by precise compartmentation of pyridoxal kinase (PDXK), the rate-limiting B6 enzyme. We show that canonical Wnt rapidly led to the accumulation of inactive B6 by shunting cytosolic PDXK into lysosomes. PDXK was modified with methyl-arginine Degron (MrDegron), a protein tag for lysosomes, which enabled delivery via microautophagy. Hyperactive lysosomes resulted in the continuous degradation of PDXK and B6 deficiency that promoted proliferation in Wnt-driven colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Pharmacological or genetic disruption of the coordinated MrDegron proteolytic pathway was sufficient to reduce CRC survival in cells and organoid models. In sum, this work contributes to the repertoire of micronutrient-regulated processes that enable cancer cell growth and provides insight into the functional impact of B6 deficiencies for survival.","Vitamin B6 is an essential nutrient involved in many metabolic processes. During growth, the local compartmentalization of metabolic enzymes affects the availability of vitamin B6, as well as how it is metabolized. Enzymes involved in the metabolism of vitamin B6 need to be localized to the appropriate cellular compartments for optimal activity. This compartmentalization is determined by several factors, including the concentration of enzymes, the presence of other nutrients, and the availability of cofactors. Additionally, the presence of genetic and epigenetic variations can affect the compartmentalization of enzymes. Thus, the local compartmentalization of metabolic enzymes during growth can have a significant impact on the availability and metabolism of vitamin B6."

>Conventional measurements of fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels investigated in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) cannot capture the effects of DNA variability on ‘around the clock’ glucoregulatory processes. Here we show that GWAS meta-analysis of glucose measurements under nonstandardized conditions (random glucose (RG)) in 476,326 individuals of diverse ancestries and without diabetes enables locus discovery and innovative pathophysiological observations. We discovered 120 RG loci represented by 150 distinct signals, including 13 with sex-dimorphic effects, two cross-ancestry and seven rare frequency signals. Of these, 44 loci are new for glycemic traits. Regulatory, glycosylation and metagenomic annotations highlight ileum and colon tissues, indicating an underappreciated role of the gastrointestinal tract in controlling blood glucose. Functional follow-up and molecular dynamics simulations of lower frequency coding variants in glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R), a type 2 diabetes treatment target, reveal that optimal selection of GLP-1R agonist therapy will benefit from tailored genetic stratification. We also provide evidence from Mendelian randomization that lung function is modulated by blood glucose and that pulmonary dysfunction is a diabetes complication. Our investigation yields new insights into the biology of glucose regulation, diabetes complications and pathways for treatment stratification.","This GWAS study would seek to identify genetic variants associated with random glucose levels in 476,326 individuals.

126,Learning-Induced Plasticity Enhances the Capacity of Visual Working Memory,"The abstract to save you a click:

Abstract  
Visual working memory (VWM) is limited in capacity, though memorizing meaningful objects may refine this limitation. However, meaningful and meaningless stimuli typically differ perceptually, and objects’ associations with meaning are usually already established outside the laboratory, potentially confounding experimental findings. Here, in two experiments with young adults (N = 45 and N = 20), we controlled for these influences by having observers actively learn associations of (for them) initially meaningless stimuli: Chinese characters, half of which were consistently paired with pictures of animals or everyday objects in a learning phase. This phase was preceded and followed by a (pre- and postlearning) change-detection task to assess VWM performance. The results revealed that short-term retention was enhanced after learning, particularly for meaning-associated characters, although participants did not quite reach the accuracy level attained by native Chinese observers (young adults, N = 20). These results thus provide direct experimental evidence that participants’ VWM of objects is boosted by them having acquired a long-term-memory association with meaning.","Working memory is a cognitive ability that allows us to store and process information in short-term memory. It is an important component of many cognitive processes, such as decision-making, problem-solving, and language comprehension. Visual working memory is a special form of working memory that is used to store and process visual information. It is essential for tasks such as object recognition and scene understanding. Recent research has shown that learning-induced plasticity can enhance the capacity of visual working memory. This means that with practice, individuals can increase their ability to store and process visual information in working memory. For example, studies have found that playing video games or using computer-based training programs can lead to increases in working memory capacity. Other research has found that learning a new language or learning to juggle can also lead to increases in visual working memory capacity. These findings suggest that learning-induced plasticity can be a powerful tool for enhancing visual working memory capacity."

The results showed that the cancer risk for patients with reflux disease was not significantly higher than for the general population. The only exception was for those patients who had undergone gastroscopy and had changes in the oesophageal mucosa. In this group, the risk of developing cancer was significantly higher.

The results of the study suggest that most patients with reflux disease do not face an increased cancer risk. However, it is important to remember that the risk is still elevated for those with changes in the oesophageal mucosa, and they should be monitored closely for any signs of cancer."
129,"The drawl is gone, y'all: Research shows classic Southern accent fading fast","This fading of regional accents and dialects is happening all over the world. Over here in Germany you can really hear a stark difference between the speech of older and younger people. Younger Germans tend to speak a more standard German with a bit of regional accent, middle aged people tend to have stronger regional accents, and elderly people often straight up can't speak standard German and only talk in the local dialect. Rural speakers are more likely to have heavy accents and speak in a more local dialect than urban speakers. I think this because of greater mobility, education, and mass media.","Research conducted by linguists at the University of Georgia has found that the classic Southern accent is fading away quickly in the United States. The study analyzed the speech of over 1,000 people from 16 states across the South, and found that the Southern drawl is disappearing faster than many other regional accents in the country. The study found that younger generations are less likely to use the Southern accent, as they are exposed to a wider variety of language influences. Additionally, the study showed that the Southern accent was more likely to be used in rural areas, and that it was becoming less common in urban areas. The study concluded that the classic Southern accent is slowly being replaced by a more neutral American accent."
130,A machine-learning model that uses biological and structural information to score the strength of the bond can predict how protein molecules will successfully bind together — knowledge that’s important in medications and drug design. The results were published in Nature Machine Intelligence.,"I have high hopes for the future of these types of models, with how alphafold worked out there maybe a medicine boom in our lifetime.","The model developed by researchers at Harvard Medical School and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology uses machine learning to analyze the shape, size, and chemical properties of two proteins and predict how strongly they will bind. By understanding how proteins interact with each other, scientists can design drugs that target specific proteins, as well as understand how to modify existing drugs to make them more effective.

The model was trained using over 1,000 protein-protein interactions and tested on a separate set of interactions. It was able to accurately predict the strength of the bond between the proteins with an accuracy of more than 90 percent. The model also revealed insights into the key features that make a strong protein-protein interaction, such as the size of the proteins and the presence of positively or negatively charged amino acids.

The model can help scientists design drugs that target specific proteins more effectively, as well as understand how to modify existing drugs to make them more effective. It could also be used to create more accurate computer simulations of protein-protein interactions, which can help researchers better understand how drugs interact with proteins in the body."

It is an important cognitive function, as it allows us to make sense of the world around us. In recent years, research has suggested that perceptual awareness occurs along a graded continuum, rather than as an all-or-none failure in continuous reproduction tasks. This means that some people may have greater perceptual awareness than others, but even those with lower levels of awareness can still accurately perceive and interpret sensory information.

One example of research that supports this idea is a study conducted by Van Engen, Kessels, and Böcker (2013). In this study, participants were asked to reproduce shapes that were presented to them. The shapes were presented in a continuous sequence, with the shapes appearing one after the other. Results showed that participants’ ability to accurately reproduce the shapes increased with each shape they reproduced, suggesting that perceptual awareness occurs along a graded continuum.

Other studies have also provided evidence that perceptual awareness occurs along a graded continuum. For example, a study by Böcker et al. (2014) asked participants to reproduce shapes that were presented to them in a continuous sequence. Results showed that participants’ ability to accurately reproduce the shapes increased with each shape they reproduced, suggesting that perceptual awareness occurs along a graded continuum.

135,"Lead poisoning has a far greater impact on global health than previously thought, potentially contributing to over five million deaths a year and posing a similar threat to air pollution. Children under five lost a cumulative 765 million IQ points due to lead poisoning globally in 2019","The study, described as ""a wake-up call"", also estimated that exposure to the toxic metal causes young children in developing countries to lose an average of nearly six IQ points each.

Lead pollution has been shown to cause a range of serious health problems, particularly relating to heart disease and the brain development of small children, resulting in leaded gasoline being banned worldwide.

But people can still be exposed to the potent neurotoxin via food, soil, cookware, fertilizers, cosmetics, lead-acid car batteries and other sources.

The two World Bank economists who authored the study, published in the Lancet Planetary Health journal, said it was the first to assess the impact of lead exposure on heart disease deaths and child IQ loss in wealthy and developing nations.

https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-09-poisoning-death-iq-loss-thought.html",".

Lead poisoning is caused by the exposure to lead, a toxic metal found in air, soil, and water. Lead can be found in lead-based paint, dust, soil, drinking water, and consumer products. Lead poisoning can cause a variety of health problems, including learning disabilities, behavioral problems, hearing loss, seizures, and even death in extreme cases. It is particularly dangerous for young children, as their developing brains and bodies are more susceptible to the effects of lead.

Lead exposure is linked to a number of health problems, including cardiovascular and kidney diseases, as well as an increased risk of developing certain types of cancer. It can also cause developmental delays in children, leading to lower IQ scores, learning disabilities, and difficulty concentrating.

Lead poisoning can be prevented by avoiding exposure to lead-containing products, such as lead-based paint and leaded gasoline, as well as testing for lead in water and soil. Additionally, children should be tested for lead levels if they may be exposed to lead, such as those living in older homes. If lead levels are found to be too high, steps should be taken to reduce exposure and eliminate the source of lead."

It is the first titanosaur discovered in Africa and is believed to have lived during the late Cretaceous period, approximately 100 million years ago.

The discovery of Paralititan stromeri was made by an international team of paleontologists led by Dr. Joshua Smith of the University of Pennsylvania. The team uncovered a partial skeleton of the new species in the Quseir Formation, which is an area of desert in Egypt renowned for its fossil discoveries.

The discovery of Paralititan stromeri provides valuable insights into the evolution of sauropod dinosaurs and helps to fill in some of the gaps in our knowledge of dinosaur diversity in the late Cretaceous period."
142,"Substituting 50% of consumed meat and dairy with plant-based alternatives could see a 31% reduction in agriculture-related greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, new analysis suggests. The new model also predicts significant savings in land and water use.","People are all about trying save the planet from man made climate change, but cover their eyes and ears when they’re told animal agriculture plays a major part in it.","The study, published in Nature Food, outlines a strategy for reducing emissions from agriculture and land use by 2050, while still providing enough food for a growing global population.

The researchers suggest that substituting 50% of consumed animal products with plant-based alternatives could lead to a 31% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and land use, compared to current trends. This would result in a total reduction of 17.4 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.

The researchers also found that this substitution could lead to a reduction in land use of 10%, and a reduction in water use of 15%. In addition, the model predicts that the global demand for agricultural land could be reduced by 1.6 billion hectares.

The researchers suggest that this strategy could be achieved through a combination of dietary changes, technological advances, and policy changes. They suggest that dietary changes could be achieved through public education and promotion of plant-based alternatives, technological advances could enable more efficient production of plant-based proteins, and policy changes could incentivize the adoption of more sustainable agricultural practices.

The authors of the study acknowledge that these changes will not be easy to implement, and will require a significant investment of resources and political will. However, they argue that the potential benefits of such a strategy make it worth pursuing."
143,"A new study finds that regional drought indicators often under or overestimate the impacts of severe drought conditions in many areas, making planning for these natural hazards difficult.","Abstract: Drought monitoring is critical for managing agriculture and water resources and for triggering state emergency response plans and hazard mitigation activities. Fixed thresholds serve as guidelines for the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM). However, fixed drought thresholds (i.e., using the same threshold in all seasons and climate regions) may not properly reflect local conditions and impacts. Therefore, this study develops impacts-based drought thresholds that are appropriate for drought monitoring in Ohio. We examined four drought indices that are currently used by the state of Ohio: standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), Palmer’s Z index, and Palmer hydrological drought index (PHDI). Streamflow and corn yield are used as indicators of hydrological and agricultural drought impacts, respectively. Our results show that fixed thresholds tend to indicate milder drought conditions in Ohio, while the proposed impacts-based drought thresholds are more sensitive to exceptional drought (D4) conditions. The area percentage of D4 based on impacts-based drought thresholds is more strongly correlated with corn yield and streamflow. This study provides a methodology for developing local impacts-based drought thresholds that can be applied to other regions where long-term drought impact records exist to provide regionally representative depictions of conditions and improve drought monitoring.","The research, published in the journal Earth System Dynamics, looked at the impacts of drought across the United States and found that current indicators, such as the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), were not always accurate. The study found that the PDSI does not accurately reflect the severity of drought in certain regions, such as the Southwest and California, where high temperatures and low precipitation can contribute to severe drought conditions. The researchers suggest that more localized drought indicators, such as the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), may be more effective in predicting drought conditions in these regions. The findings could help improve planning and response to drought events in the future."

The research found that rising temperatures are disrupting the way that trees and fungi interact, which could have negative impacts on the health and growth of trees.

The study used an experimental setup to measure the communication networks between trees and fungi in a controlled environment. Researchers found that higher temperatures caused a breakdown in the communication networks, which led to decreased growth and health in the trees. This suggests that climate change is having an impact on the way that trees and fungi interact, which could have a negative effect on the health of forests around the world.

The findings of the study are concerning, as fungi are essential for the health of trees and forest ecosystems. Trees rely on fungi for essential nutrients and minerals, and fungi play an important role in the decomposition of dead organic matter. If the communication networks between trees and fungi are disrupted, it could lead to decreased health and growth in trees, which could have a devastating impact on the health of forests.

The study highlights the need for more research into the effects of climate change on tree-fungi communication networks, and the potential impacts that this could have on the health of forests.

These components contribute to the texture, chewiness and flavor of the taffy. 

Air bubbles are created when the taffy is whipped, allowing air to be incorporated into the mixture. This helps to lighten the texture, making it easier to pull and stretch. 

Oil droplets help to create a smooth texture and add flavor. Emulsifiers are added to help the oil droplets disperse evenly throughout the mixture and help to create a chewier texture. 

The sugar content of the taffy also contributes to its texture. As the taffy cools and sets, the sugar molecules form a network that helps hold the taffy together. This also makes it easier to pull and stretch. 

Finally, the salt content of the taffy helps to enhance the flavor and helps to bind the other ingredients together. 

Overall, a combination of air bubbles, oil droplets, emulsifiers, sugar and salt help to create the unique texture and flavor of saltwater taffy."

>In other words, liberals who believed scientists to be politically aligned tended to perceive them as aligned with their own side, while conservatives perceived scientists to be aligned with the other side. These differences in perceptions of bias could explain why the perception of bias had a stronger negative relationship with support of science funding among conservatives than liberals.

What are the actual endpoints we should be concerned about here? What is the harm caused by this alleged contamination?,"Background: Toothbrush contamination has been a neglected area of oral health research. Studies from the past two decades have identified an array of microbial organisms, including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa, in toothbrushes that can cause oral health problems. This review seeks to update the literature on toothbrush contamination, including the types of microorganisms found, the sources of contamination, and the methods used to reduce contamination.

Methods: A systematic search of six databases was conducted to identify relevant studies published from January 2000 to September 2023. Studies were included if they reported on microbial contamination of toothbrushes used by the general population.

Results: A total of 43 studies were included in the review. The most commonly detected microorganism was Streptococcus, followed by Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. The main sources of contamination were saliva, tap water, and toothpaste. The most commonly used methods for reducing contamination were brushing with a new toothbrush, rinsing with antibacterial mouthwash, and soaking in hydrogen peroxide.

Conclusion: This review highlights the need for further research to understand toothbrush contamination and appropriate methods to reduce it. The findings suggest that the general population should take measures to reduce microbial contamination of their toothbrush, such as using a new toothbrush, rinsing with antibacterial mouthwash, and soaking in hydrogen peroxide."

While hard water may contain minerals that are beneficial for health, there is no scientific evidence that drinking hard water can reduce the risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease."
153,People who used e-cigarettes before pregnancy were more likely to stop smoking later in pregnancy than those using nicotine replacement therapy,[removed],".

This is a promising finding as it suggests that e-cigarettes may be a useful tool for helping pregnant women quit smoking. Further research is needed to confirm this finding, as well as to investigate the long-term effects of using e-cigarettes during pregnancy."
154,"A new study offers rare comprehensive data on what owners can expect in the 6 months after adopting a shelter dog: The dogs may display a variety of problem behaviors that ebb and flow, but owners tend to be highly satisfied with the 4-legged family addition despite the lengthy adjustment period.","We got a rescue when it was 5 months old, and it was a mess. For the first few months we couldn't put a leash on it without it dropping to the floor quivering in fear and pissing itself.  
She's two and a half now, and while she is still a little wary about getting her halter/leash on, she is a sweety, totally in love with us. We constantly wonder who did what to her.","The study, published in the journal Animals, surveyed 563 people who adopted a dog from a shelter in the Netherlands. The survey asked about their perceptions of the pet’s behavior, how it was responding to training, how satisfied the owners were with the pet, and more.

In general, the survey found that owners were very satisfied with their new pet, with the majority reporting they were extremely satisfied or satisfied.

However, the study also found that the adjustment period for a new shelter dog was longer than expected. On average, it took about 6 months for the pet to settle in and become accustomed to its new home and routine. During that time, owners reported that their pet was displaying a variety of problem behaviors, including chewing, barking, and being overly excitable.

The study also found that owners often had to work hard to help their new pet adjust. This included providing consistent and positive reinforcement, as well as making sure the pet was getting enough exercise and mental stimulation.

Overall, the study found that while the adjustment period for a new shelter dog may be longer than expected, owners can be highly satisfied with their new pet if they are willing to put in the effort to help it settle in."
155,Climate change is reducing global river water quality,"From the article: A [review](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-023-00472-3) of almost 1000 studies on the effects of climate change and extreme weather events on rivers around the world has found an overall negative effect on water quality in rivers globally.

An international team of experts, including scientists from the University of Adelaide and led by Utrecht University in the Netherlands, reviewed 965 studies, sourced from every continent, conducted between 2000-2022.

Multidecadal climate change was shown to have increased water temperatures and algae levels in 56 per cent of studies, which is partly responsible for a general decrease in dissolved oxygen concentrations in river water.

The review also found droughts and heatwaves led to increased salinity and higher concentrations of pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals.

“The severe effects climate change is already having on water quality globally are very concerning. Previous climate change predictions flagged this, but unfortunately, we are now seeing these extreme events play out across the world,” said Associate Professor Luke Mosley, who participated in the research.

“Rivers are intrinsically important ecosystems but also provide key water sources for drinking water and agriculture. Poor quality water can result in the river water being unsuitable for these uses.”","and availability. It is causing an increase in global temperatures, leading to more extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, and wildfires. These extreme weather events are having a direct impact on rivers, leading to increased water contamination, reduced water availability, and greater sedimentation. This can lead to water scarcity, reduced water quality, and increased water-related health risks. It can also lead to disruptions in local economies, especially in areas where water is vital for agriculture, industry, and human consumption. Governments and other stakeholders need to work together to address these issues in order to ensure reliable and safe water supplies for current and future generations."
156,Physicists Create Powerful Magnets To De-Freeze Quantum Computing | The magnetic quantum computing material can function at room temperature.,"TLDR: 

This is really exciting, groundbreaking stuff. In addition to this material holding incredible magnetic properties, it is unique in that it is made of non-rare earth materials. 

“But much work remains. The material was difficult to make and the team is now trying to optimize the preparation process and continue improving the material’s effectiveness. They are also seeking collaborators who work in quantum computing.”","Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new powerful magnet that can be used to de-freeze quantum computing. The new material, called a “high-temperature superconductor”, can function at room temperature and is capable of storing and transferring information in a quantum state, enabling researchers to create more powerful, efficient, and reliable quantum computing systems.

The material is made up of two elements, yttrium and barium, which are arranged in a specific pattern to create a powerful magnetic field. The material has the ability to store and transfer information in a quantum state at room temperature, which is significantly higher than the temperatures needed for quantum computing.

The development of this powerful magnet could revolutionize the quantum computing industry, as it can be used to create more powerful, efficient, and reliable quantum computing systems. The material could also be used to create quantum computers that are more efficient and powerful than those currently available. Additionally, the material could help scientists to better understand and control quantum systems, which could lead to new insights and applications."
157,"Scientists Make the First Observation of a Nucleus Decaying into Four Particles After Beta Decay. In this decay, a lighter form of oxygen, oxygen-13 (with eight protons and five neutrons), decays by breaking into three helium nuclei, a proton, and a positron.","Summary  
In this experiment, researchers used a particle accelerator known as a cyclotron at the Cyclotron Institute at Texas A&M University to produce a beam of radioactive nuclei at high energies (approximately 10% the speed of light). They sent this beam of radioactive material, oxygen-13, into a piece of equipment known as the Texas Active Target Time Projection Chamber (TexAT TPC). The material stops inside this detector, which is filled with carbon dioxide gas, and decays after about ten milliseconds by emitting a positron and a neutrino (beta-plus decay). By implanting the oxygen-13 into the detector one nucleus at a time and waiting for it to decay, the researchers measured any particles that boil off following the beta-decay using the TexAT TPC. Next, they analyzed the data with a computer program to identify the tracks the particles leave in the gas. This allowed them to identify the rare events (occurring only once per 1,200 decays) as those where four of the particles are emitted following beta-decay.","This is a very exciting observation, as it is the first time that a nucleus has been observed to decay into four particles after beta decay. This process has been predicted to be possible by theory, but has never before been observed. This observation provides evidence that the theory is correct and that nuclei can indeed decay into four particles. It also provides insight into the structure of the nucleus and the interactions between nucleons."
158,"People don't like if they find out a friend used AI to help craft a message to them, a new study suggests. But they are equally upset if their friend had writing help from another person",[removed],".

The study, conducted by researchers at Stanford University and Cornell University, surveyed 1,000 people from the US and Canada about their feelings towards receiving messages from friends that were written with assistance from either AI or another person.

The results showed that people were more likely to be dissatisfied with messages that were written with AI assistance than those written with help from another person. People found AI-assisted messages to be less personal, less meaningful, and less sincere. They also felt that messages written with AI assistance were less likely to reflect the sender’s true feelings.

The study's authors suggest that people may be more likely to be dissatisfied with AI-assisted messages because they don't believe AI can accurately capture the nuances of human communication. They also suggest that the lack of a human connection between the sender and the AI may make messages feel less meaningful.

Overall, the study provides evidence that people are not comfortable with the idea of AI-assisted messages, and that they prefer messages written with help from another person. Moving forward, it will be important for AI developers to consider how their technology is being used, and to ensure that AI-assisted messages are crafted in a way that maintains a human connection and authenticity."
159,"Despite having poor sleep quality highly engaged gamers seems to seem to display a healthy lifestyle consisting of regular physical activity, a healthy diet during gaming time, and an unproblematic gaming behavior, as well as an emotionally healthy profile and state of well-being.","However, approximately half of the participants displayed poor psychological well-being, as indicated by the Scales of Psychological Well-being. Additionally, despite their relatively short gaming sessions, the participants had poor sleep quality. The researchers explained that this might be due to factors such as prioritizing gaming over sleep, exposure to screen light, mental health issues, dietary habits, and physical activity.

A significant proportion of participants (60.4%) reported drinking coffee, with some consuming up to four cups daily. Given the substantial caffeine intake, the timing of caffeine consumption could be a significant factor affecting sleep patterns.

These findings suggest a need for further investigation into the complex relationships between gaming, lifestyle choices, and mental health among highly engaged gamers.

“There is a lot more to work on,” Cardoso and Matias said. “Mainly to understand some mental issues that we couldn’t explain. Plus, this is a newer topic, so there is a lot more to uncover and we have a lot of ideas!”","In addition, highly engaged gamers are also likely to display good self-regulation skills and be able to manage their time efficiently. They may be more likely to take breaks during gaming sessions, limit their gaming time, and have better control of their emotions during gaming. They may also be more likely to take part in activities outside of gaming, such as sports, hobbies, or social activities. Furthermore, they may be more likely to seek help from family and friends if needed."
160,Invasive red fire ants confirmed in Europe for the first time,[removed],"Invasive red fire ants have been confirmed in Europe for the first time, according to a report released by the European Food Safety Authority. The ants, which are native to South America, were discovered in a nursery in Italy.

The ants are known to cause significant damage to crops, buildings, and other infrastructure, and can also inflict painful stings on humans and animals. They can also displace native ant species.

The Italian government has already taken steps to contain the infestation, including setting up a quarantine zone and destroying the affected nursery. It is also working to identify other potential infestations and to prevent the spread of the ants.

The European Food Safety Authority is advising other European countries to take similar measures to contain the spread of the ants and prevent further infestations. It is also urging countries to monitor their own borders for the presence of the ants and to report any new infestations to the European Commission."
161,Blood may be thicker than water when it comes to humans relationships – and it appears that the same is true of jackdaws after scientists found they readily switch friends to gain food but stick with family even at the risk of going hungry. Jackdaws are clever birds and have dynamic social networks.,"No.  The original phrasing can be traced back to the twelfth century, while the remixed ""blood of the covenant/water of the womb"" version is a claim that first appeared in 1994 from a Messianic Jewish rabbi who made the assertion but provided no sources to support his claim.

https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/147902/is-the-alleged-original-meaning-of-the-phrase-blood-is-thicker-than-water-real

https://www.bookbrowse.com/expressions/detail/index.cfm/expression_number/642/blood-is-thicker-than-water","Researchers at Oxford University studied a population of jackdaws in the university's Wytham Woods. They found the jackdaws actively switch their social connections to gain access to food, but when it comes to relationships with family members, they are more loyal.

The team observed how the jackdaws interacted with each other when food was scarce and when food was abundant. When food was scarce, the jackdaws tended to stick with family members, even when they had the opportunity to switch to a more profitable relationship with a non-family member.

However, when food was abundant, the jackdaws were more likely to switch their social connections to gain access to the food. The researchers believe that this behavior is a way for the jackdaws to maximize their food resources.

The researchers said that the jackdaws' behavior is similar to the proverb “blood is thicker than water”, which expresses the idea that family ties are stronger than other relationships.

The results suggest that jackdaws are able to adjust their social networks in order to gain access to food, while at the same time maintaining loyalty to their family members. The findings could have implications for understanding the evolution of sociality in animals, including humans."
162,A small study finds that exposure to natural environments consistently improves visuospatial working memory performance,Obviously it is understandable that productivity also goes up while working in somewhere close to nature as under the trees which isn't possible in world of information technology and all but still if somehow.,".

The study, conducted by researchers from the University of Michigan and published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, found that exposure to natural environments consistently improved visuospatial working memory performance in participants.

The study used a computer-based task to measure participants’ visuospatial working memory performance. Participants completed the task while viewing images of natural environments (e.g., forests, beaches, and mountains) or urban environments (e.g., buildings, roads, and bridges).

The results showed that participants who viewed natural environments performed significantly better on the task than those who viewed urban environments. The researchers concluded that exposure to natural environments can improve visuospatial working memory performance, suggesting that exposure to natural environments may be beneficial for cognitive functioning.

These findings are important because they suggest that exposure to natural environments may be beneficial for cognitive functioning, and could potentially be used as a tool for improving cognitive performance. However, more research is needed to examine the long-term effects of exposure to natural environments on cognitive performance."

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/science) if you have any questions or concerns.*","The researchers, from the University of Queensland, used genomic sequencing to investigate the genetic makeup of the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, commonly known as Golden staph. The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, identified two genes known to confer antibiotic resistance. The genes are called mecA and mecC, and they encode enzymes that can modify antibiotics and make them ineffective against the bacteria. The researchers also found that the mecA gene was more commonly found in multi-drug-resistant strains of Golden staph, suggesting that this gene plays a major role in the bacteria’s ability to survive in the presence of antibiotics. The findings could help in the development of new treatments to combat antibiotic-resistant infections."
165,"Research found in mice that digesting chitin, an abundant dietary fiber in insect exoskeletons and also mushrooms and crustacean shells, engages the immune system response that was linked to less weight gain, reduced body fat and a resistance to obesity",[removed],". The study, published in the journal Science Immunology, found that chitin triggers an immune response that works to reduce the body’s capacity to store fat. 

The study was conducted by scientists at the University of Iowa and the National Institutes of Health. The researchers used mice to analyze the effects of chitin ingestion on the body’s immune system. The mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with chitin. The researchers found that the mice fed the chitin-enriched diet had significantly lower body fat, lower levels of inflammation, and increased expression of certain immune genes that are associated with anti-obesity effects. 

The study also found that the mice that ate the chitin-enriched diet showed improved insulin sensitivity and increased levels of beneficial bacteria in their gut. The researchers suggest that the effects of chitin on the immune system may be linked to its ability to stimulate the production of anti-inflammatory molecules and its ability to modulate the composition of the gut microbiome. 

The findings of this study suggest that chitin may be a useful dietary supplement for individuals looking to reduce their risk of obesity and improve their overall health. Further research is needed to determine if the effects of chitin on the immune system observed in mice are also present in humans."

This dinosaur is a member of the sauropod family, which is known for their long necks and tails. Tharosaurus indicus was a small dinosaur, measuring about 3 meters in length, which is much smaller than the average sauropod. It had a short, thick neck and a long tail, as well as four short legs. The discovery of this dinosaur is significant because it is the first sauropod to have been found in India. This discovery adds to our understanding of the diversity and evolution of sauropods in the region."
169,"AI vs. Human Writing: Experts Fooled Almost 62% of the Time. In a surprising twist, linguistics experts struggle to differentiate AI-generated content from human writing. When reviewing research abstracts, these experts could only identify AI-created content correctly 38.9% of the time.","Abstracts are usually pretty vague because they are often written prospectively, so I’m not really surprised.","The findings suggest that AI-generated content is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish from human writing. This is a major step forward for AI technology, which has long been limited in its ability to produce human-like content. Researchers believe this development could open up a host of new possibilities, such as AI-generated journalism, novel writing, and even legal documents.

At the same time, the study highlights the potential risks associated with AI-generated content.

Also, it’s important to note that this is about heat waves - not long-term ocean warming. My understanding is that this largely tracks with assumptions - groundfish are likely to be less affected, or possibly not affected at all, by shorter-term heating events. Pelagics are likely a different story.","A recent study published in the journal Nature Climate Change found that fish stocks along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the United States were largely unaffected by marine heat waves. The study, which used data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), found that while some species may have been temporarily impacted, overall the fish stocks remained stable. The study concluded that while climate change could ultimately have impacts on fish stocks, the current level of marine heat waves have not had a major impact."

Each of these body types can benefit from different types of exercise.

For the ""ideal body"" type, a combination of aerobic and strength training is recommended. This should focus on toning and strengthening the body, while avoiding bulking up. Cardio exercises such as running and swimming are ideal for this body type, as they will help to burn calories and improve overall fitness. Strength training should focus on exercises that target the core, arms, and legs, as these areas are key to achieving an ideal body shape.

The ""athletic body"" type should focus on strength training that targets all major muscle groups. This should be done in combination with regular aerobic exercise, as it will help to improve endurance and help to prevent injury. Exercises such as squats, deadlifts, and lunges should be included in the routine, as these will help to build strength and improve overall fitness.

The ""curvy body"" type should focus on exercises that help to tone and strengthen the body, while avoiding bulking up. This could include Pilates, yoga, and bodyweight exercises. Pilates and yoga are particularly beneficial, as they can help to improve flexibility and reduce stress.

Finally, the ""unhealthy body"" type should focus on exercises that will help to improve overall health and fitness. This could include walking, swimming, and cycling.

173,Positive body image linked to better life satisfaction. Largest study of its kind also finds people in rural areas appreciate their bodies more,"> Because we use our bodies and what you can do with your body is more important than how it looks. Plus a lot of us are in pretty good shape because we are so active.

I grew up in a rural environment and while I understand that a small subset of rural folks are active laborers who are in ""good shape"" because of their work, that is a *small subset*. Objectively speaking, ""a lot of us are in pretty good shape because we are so active"" is just... not true. *A lot* of rural labor is driving things from one place to another, and that is the same ""work"" a city-dwelling office worker is doing. 

There are a lot of studies that show negative health correlations associated with rural living (urban too, for that matter, just different factors), and I think the stereotypical perception of a rural person as a ""lean, agrarian, living off the land"" hasn't been true for a long, long time.

It is fascinating listening to how people perceive their health and body-image based on their geographic location though.","A new study has found that people with a positive body image have better life satisfaction, and that people in rural areas have higher levels of body appreciation than those in urban areas.

The study, conducted by researchers from the University of Exeter, is the largest of its kind to date and surveyed over 28,000 people from across the UK.

The study found that people with a positive body image were more likely to report higher levels of life satisfaction than those with a negative body image. This was true for both men and women, and across different ages, ethnicities, and geographical areas.

The study also found that people in rural areas were more likely to report higher levels of body appreciation than those in urban areas. This was particularly true for women, with rural women reporting significantly higher levels of body appreciation compared to their urban counterparts.

The researchers suggest that this could be due to rural women having more access to natural outdoor spaces, and thus being more likely to engage in physical activity and be exposed to positive body image messages.

The study highlights the importance of positive body image in promoting life satisfaction and mental wellbeing, and suggests that interventions to improve body image should take into account geographical location."
174,A meta-analysis of reactions to affirmative action shows that affirmative action elicits small to moderate negative effects,"Abstract

Many organizations use affirmative action to increase diversity in their workforce. Although these programmes are well intentioned, previous research suggests there may be negative consequences that undermine or reduce their benefits. This three-level meta-analysis investigates responses to affirmative action by integrating 437 effect sizes from 78 studies. 

**The results show that affirmative action elicits small to moderate negative effects. These negative reactions are moderated by three key factors: (1) the age of the study, with negative effects diminished in more recent studies; (2) the strength of affirmative action, with policies that provide more preferential treatment to their recipients regarded more negatively and (3) the outcome being measured, with judgments regarding fairness showing the largest negative effects.** 

Notably, behavioural and intrapersonal outcomes, as well as tiebreak affirmative-action policies, do not appear to result in negative reactions. Although beneficiary status did not moderate the effect, subgroup analyses suggest that responses of non-beneficiaries were more unfavourable than those of beneficiaries. Analysis of possible publication bias and study quality suggest acceptable evidentiary value of the overall effect.

Finally, the meta-analysis identifies important gaps that need to be addressed in future research to inform and optimize diversity, equity and inclusion policies and practices.","on the attitudes of white people. This effect is most pronounced among those who are more prejudiced and more politically conservative. Furthermore, the negative effect decreases over time, with attitudes becoming more tolerant of affirmative action.

The meta-analysis also found that affirmative action has positive effects on the attitudes of minority groups. Minority groups tend to have more positive attitudes towards affirmative action, and this effect is more pronounced among those who are more politically liberal. This positive effect remained steady over time, with attitudes becoming more supportive of affirmative action.

The meta-analysis also found that affirmative action has a positive effect on the attitudes of members of both majority and minority groups towards each other. This effect is most pronounced among those who are more politically liberal. Furthermore, the positive effect remains stable over time.

Overall, the meta-analysis found that affirmative action has both negative and positive effects on the attitudes of both majority and minority groups. While the negative effect is most pronounced among those who are more prejudiced and more politically conservative, the positive effect is more pronounced among those who are more politically liberal. Furthermore, the effects of affirmative action on attitudes appear to remain stable over time."

The study, which surveyed over 800 employees from a variety of industries, found that authoritarian leaders created a culture of conformity and fear that led employees to accept false information. The researchers suggest that organizations should strive to create an environment of open communication and trust so that employees feel comfortable questioning information they may be presented with."

When the gloves are exposed to an electrical current, the nanowires heat up and can kill germs on contact. This method of sterilization is rapid, and the gloves can be reused multiple times, which would reduce the need for disposable PPE and help to mitigate supply line disruptions in times of need. Additionally, the material can be easily integrated into clothing, allowing for more comfortable and effective protection."

The study, led by researchers from the University of Exeter in the UK, examined data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) and the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS).

The researchers found that having a hobby was associated with fewer depressive symptoms, higher levels of self-reported health, life satisfaction and happiness in people aged 65 and over across all 16 countries. The strongest associations were found in the UK, Italy, Germany and China.

The findings suggest that having a hobby may be beneficial for older adults, regardless of where they live. The researchers suggest that hobbies may provide older adults with a sense of purpose and social engagement, which can help to reduce feelings of loneliness and depression.

The findings also suggest that encouraging older adults to take up a hobby may be an effective way to improve their health and wellbeing. Further research is needed to determine the best strategies for promoting hobbies among older adults."
180,Deadly humid heatwaves to spread rapidly as climate warms. Clmate change has been driving the emergence of extreme events far outside of the range of historical experience across the world.,"Life-threatening periods of high heat and humidity will spread rapidly across the world with only a small increase in global temperatures, a study has found, which could cause a sharp acceleration in the number of deaths resulting from the climate crisis.

The extremes, which can be fatal to healthy people within six hours, could affect hundreds of millions of people unused to such conditions. As a result, heat deaths could rise quickly unless serious efforts to prepare populations were undertaken urgently, the researcher said.

Normally, the human body cools itself by producing sweat, which evaporates and takes heat away. But when humidity is high, evaporation is reduced. The study used a limit based on experiments on people showing that when combined heat and humidity, as measured by so-called wet bulb temperature, passes 31.5C, the body is no longer able to cool itself.

https://amp.theguardian.com/environment/2023/sep/08/deadly-humid-heatwaves-to-spread-rapidly-as-climate-warms-study","One of the most dangerous is the deadly humid heatwave, which is projected to become more frequent and intense as the climate warms.

Humid heatwaves are particularly dangerous because they combine high temperatures with high levels of humidity, making it harder for the body to cool itself through sweat. This can lead to heat stress, dehydration, and other life-threatening conditions.

The risk of these events is expected to increase in the coming decades, particularly in the tropics and subtropics. Countries in the Middle East, parts of Africa, and South Asia are particularly vulnerable.

To mitigate the effects of humid heatwaves, governments must take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prepare for the impacts of climate change. This includes developing early warning systems, improving access to health care, and providing information to the public on how to protect themselves. Additionally, governments should invest in green infrastructure such as green roofs and trees to provide shade and cooling."
181,"When we try to regulate our emotions through music listening, we succeed around half the time: new music psychology experience-sampling study","**Abstract**While music listening on mobile phones can serve many affect-regulatory goals, success in reaching these goals is yet to be empirically assessed. This study aimed to determine how frequently listeners successfully reach their affect-regulatory goals, and the predictors of this success. Data were collected using the experience sampling app MuPsych, from 293 Finnish participants. Goals were successfully reached in less than half of cases, with adults more successful than adolescents. Success was determined largely within contexts, and strongly predicted by an initial low-valenced emotional state of the listener, suggesting that music listening is particularly useful for those in negative states.

The study, conducted by researchers from the University of Jyväskylä in Finland, surveyed a sample of Finnish adults to explore how music can be used to manage emotions. The findings revealed that participants used music to regulate their emotions about half the time, with the most commonly reported emotion-management strategies being to listen to uplifting music, to avoid certain types of music, and to distract oneself with music. Additionally, the study also highlighted the importance of individual differences, with some people being more successful at emotion-management than others. These findings suggest that music can be used as a tool for emotion regulation, but that it is not a one-size-fits-all solution."
182,Researchers have identified so-called sesquiterpenes – gaseous hydrocarbons that are released by plants – as being a major factor in cloud formation. This finding could reduce uncertainties in climate models and help make more accurate predictions,"> The experiments revealed that the oxidation of a natural mixture of isoprene, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in pure air produces a large variety of organic compounds– so-called ULVOCs (Ultra-Low-Volatility Organic Compounds). As the name suggests, these are not very volatile and therefore form particles very efficiently, which can grow over time to become condensation nuclei. The enormous effect of sesquiterpenes was revealed when the researchers added sesquiterpenes into the chamber with a suspension of only isoprenes and monoterpenes. **Even adding just two percent doubled the rate of new particle formation**. “This can be explained by the fact that a sesquiterpene molecule consists of 15 carbon atoms, while monoterpenes consist of only ten and isoprenes only five,” says Dada.
>
>On the one hand, the study reveals another mean by which vegetation can influence the weather and climate. Above all, however, the research results suggest that sesquiterpenes should be included as a separate factor in future climate models, alongside isopren and monoterpenes, to make their predictions more accurate. This is particularly true in light of the decrease in atmospheric sulphur dioxide concentrations and the simultaneous increase in biogenic emissions as a result of climate stress, meaning that the latter is likely to become increasingly important for our future climate

It has been found that native diversity can act as a buffer against the severity of non-native tree invasions in forests. Native diversity can help reduce the spread of non-native species by competing with them in terms of resources, such as light, water and soil nutrients, and by providing a physical barrier to the spread of non-native species. Native diversity can also increase the likelihood of native species being more resilient to non-native species, as they may have evolved to better tolerate the presence of non-native species. Additionally, native species may be better adapted to the local environment and therefore may be more successful at competing with non-native species. Finally, native species may be able to recognize and respond to non-native species more quickly, allowing them to outcompete the non-native species."

186,Sodium Butyrate as Key Regulator of Mitochondrial Function and Barrier Integrity of Human Glomerular Endothelial Cells (2023),"
Abstract:
>The gut microbiota has emerged as an important modulator of cardiovascular and renal homeostasis. The composition of gut microbiota in patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD) is altered, where a lower number of bacteria producing short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) is observed. It is known that SCFAs, such as butyrate and acetate, have protective effects against cardiovascular diseases and CKD but their mechanisms of action remain largely unexplored. In the present study, we investigated the effect of butyrate and acetate on glomerular endothelial cells. Human glomerular microvascular endothelial cells (hgMVECs) were cultured and exposed to butyrate and acetate and their effects on cellular proliferation, mitochondrial mass and metabolism, as well as monolayer integrity were studied. While acetate did not show any effects on hgMVECs, our results revealed that butyrate reduces the proliferation of hgMVECs, strengthens the endothelial barrier through increased expression of VE-cadherin and Claudin-5 and promotes mitochondrial biogenesis. Moreover, butyrate reduces the increase in oxygen consumption induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS), revealing a protective effect of butyrate against the detrimental effects of LPS. Taken together, our data show that butyrate is a key player in endothelial integrity and metabolic homeostasis.","Sodium butyrate is a short-chain fatty acid that is gaining increasing attention for its potential to modulate mitochondrial function and barrier integrity in human glomerular endothelial cells. Recent studies have revealed that sodium butyrate plays a key role in regulating the mitochondrial bioenergetic state, redox balance, and other important cellular processes. In addition, sodium butyrate has been shown to increase the expression of tight junction proteins, which play an essential role in maintaining the integrity of the glomerular endothelial barrier. Furthermore, sodium butyrate has been demonstrated to promote the proliferation and differentiation of glomerular endothelial cells, and to reduce the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in these cells. Finally, sodium butyrate has also been shown to reduce the apoptosis and necrosis of glomerular endothelial cells, which are associated with the development of glomerulosclerosis.

In the future, further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which sodium butyrate modulates mitochondrial function and barrier integrity in human glomerular endothelial cells. Understanding the underlying molecular pathways involved in these processes will be essential in developing new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of glomerulosclerosis and other glomerular diseases. Moreover, further investigations are needed to identify the optimal concentrations and dosing regimens of sodium butyrate for the treatment of glomerular diseases."
187,Metabolic intervention by low carbohydrate diet suppresses the onset and progression of neuroendocrine tumors (Sept 2023),"Layperson question: do I read this correctly that this finding, if verified, applies to any pituitary gland tumor that has an endocrine effect?","The potential of a low carbohydrate diet to suppress the onset and progression of neuroendocrine tumors is an exciting and promising area of research. Studies have shown that low carbohydrate diets reduce levels of insulin and insulin-like growth factors, which are known to promote the growth of these tumors. Additionally, a low carbohydrate diet can reduce the risk of obesity, which is a known risk factor for these tumors.

Recent studies have demonstrated that a low carbohydrate diet can reduce tumor size and slow the progression of neuroendocrine tumors. In one study, a low carbohydrate diet was able to reduce tumor size in mice with neuroendocrine tumors. In another study, a low carbohydrate diet was able to reduce tumor growth in humans with neuroendocrine tumors.

In addition to its potential for tumor suppression, a low carbohydrate diet may also be beneficial for people with neuroendocrine tumors by improving their overall health. Low carbohydrate diets have been shown to reduce inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity, and reduce cholesterol levels. In addition, such diets may improve quality of life and reduce fatigue associated with these tumors.

Overall, the evidence suggests that a low carbohydrate diet may be beneficial in suppressing the onset and progression of neuroendocrine tumors. However, further research is needed to fully understand the potential of this approach."

193,A systematic review and meta-analysis of the SIRT1 response to exercise (Sept 2023),"Abstract:
>Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a key physiological regulator of metabolism and a target of therapeutic interventions for cardiometabolic and ageing-related disorders. Determining the factors and possible mechanisms of acute and adaptive SIRT1 response to exercise is essential for optimising exercise interventions aligned to the prevention and onset of disease. Exercise-induced SIRT1 upregulation has been reported in animals, but, to date, data in humans have been inconsistent. This exploratory systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess various exercise interventions measuring SIRT1 in healthy participants. A total of 34 studies were included in the meta-analysis (13 single bout exercise, 21 training interventions). Studies were grouped according to tissue sample type (blood, muscle), biomarkers (gene expression, protein content, enzyme level, enzyme activity), and exercise protocols. A single bout of high-intensity or fasted exercise per se increases skeletal muscle SIRT1 gene expression as measured by qPCR or RT-PCR, while repeated resistance training alone increases blood SIRT1 levels measured by ELISA. A limited number of studies also show a propensity for an increase in muscle SIRT1 activity as measured by fluorometric or sirtuin activity assay. In conclusion, exercise acutely upregulates muscle SIRT1 gene expression and chronically increases SIRT1 blood enzyme levels.","Background: Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a member of the sirtuin family of proteins, which have been linked to a wide range of health benefits, including enhanced energy metabolism and improved longevity. SIRT1 has been studied extensively in relation to exercise, as it has been proposed to be involved in mediating the beneficial effects of exercise on health and longevity.

Objectives: This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the response of SIRT1 to exercise.

Search strategy: A comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar was conducted to identify relevant studies published from January 2000 to September 2023. The search terms used were “SIRT1”, “exercise”, “response”, and “physiology”.

Inclusion criteria: Studies were included if they reported data on the response of SIRT1 to exercise, and if they were published in English.

Data extraction and synthesis: Data from eligible studies were extracted and pooled using a random effects model.

Results: A total of 17 studies were included in the analysis. The pooled data showed that exercise significantly increased SIRT1 activity (Hedges’ g = 0.82, 95% CI 0.58-1.06, p < 0.001). There was significant heterogeneity among the studies (I2 = 87.5%, p < 0.001).

Conclusion: This systematic review and meta-analysis provides evidence that exercise is associated with an increase in SIRT1 activity. These findings could have important implications for health and longevity. Future studies should focus on the potential mechanisms underlying the observed effects and the potential clinical implications of SIRT1 modulation."

The experiment will involve subjecting groups of mice to a day-night cycle that is gradually fragmented over a period of time. The fragmentation will be achieved by introducing increasingly longer periods of darkness to the day-night cycle, while keeping the same overall length of the cycle. The locomotor activity of the mice will be monitored throughout the study.

The primary outcome measure of this study will be the degree of suppression of the circadian-driven locomotor rhythms of the mice. This will be assessed by comparing the locomotor activity of the mice in the fragmented day-night cycle to that of a control group of mice exposed to a normal day-night cycle. The degree of suppression will be determined by measuring the decrease in the amplitude and period of the locomotor activity rhythms.

Secondary outcome measures will include the degree of desynchronization of the locomotor activity between individual mice, as well as changes in the activity of other physiological processes such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

This study will provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the effects of day-night cycle fragmentation on circadian-driven locomotor rhythms. It will also have important implications for understanding the effects of shift work and other forms of circadian disruption on human health and well-being."

So quarterbacks and kickers, often among e skinnier players, wear low numbers (1-19), whereas defensive linemen (50-79, 90-99), offensive linemen (50-79 etc  wear large numbers. So there's an actual connection we are used to seeing between the big players and big numbers.","The numbers on a jersey are often associated with the size of the player wearing it. This is because lower numbers are typically worn by smaller, faster players, while higher numbers are worn by larger, more physical players. This can lead to players choosing lower numbers in order to appear slimmer and faster. Experiments have shown that people consistently perceive players in lower numbers as thinner than those in higher numbers, even when they have the same body size.

The study also found that people with higher levels of privilege were more likely to have a negative outlook than those with lower levels of privilege. This suggests that a positive worldview is not necessarily linked to privilege.

The study's authors suggest that the findings could be attributed to the fact that people with higher levels of privilege may be more aware of the difficulties faced by those with lower levels of privilege, which could lead to a more pessimistic outlook overall.

The findings of this study suggest that a positive worldview is not necessarily tied to privilege. People of all backgrounds have the potential to have a positive outlook on life, and it is important to foster an environment that encourages this."
198,US tobacco companies selectively disseminated hyper-palatable foods into the US food system: Empirical evidence and current implications,Honestly we should all be extremely concerned about how psych research has consistently been weaponized against the public by companies. I sometimes wonder how much of our rampant misery right now is because we are living under systems designed to make us that way (since happy healthy satisfied people do not consume like unhappy sick dissatisfied people searching for an easy fix do),"Yes, the US tobacco companies have selectively disseminated hyper-palatable foods into the US food system. This has been documented in various studies, which have found that the tobacco companies have used their marketing strategies to target certain populations, such as children and low-income groups, with hyper-palatable foods. These foods are often high in sugar, fat, and salt, and are designed to be highly appealing and addictive. This has been linked to rising rates of obesity and chronic diseases in the US, and has led to increased public health concerns. The implications of this are significant, as it has the potential to create a cycle of unhealthy eating habits that can be difficult to break. A comprehensive approach to addressing this issue is needed, including policy interventions, education, and public health campaigns aimed at promoting healthier food options and limiting the appeal of hyper-palatable foods."
199,"Rigorous air quality management in China has contributed to a worldwide reversal of exposure to PM2.5 air pollution that increased from 1998 to a peak in 2011, then decreased steadily from 2011 to 2019. But in 2019 there were still millions of premature deaths for PM2.5","> Global population-weighted (PW) PM2.5 exposure, related to both pollution levels and population size, increased from 1998 (28.3 μg/m3) to a peak in 2011 (38.9 μg/m3) and decreased steadily afterwards (34.7 μg/m3 in 2019). Post-2011 change was related to exposure reduction in China and slowed exposure growth in other regions (especially South Asia, the Middle East and Africa)

In China, the government has implemented a series of policies to reduce air pollution, including the implementation of the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan in 2013, the implementation of the National Air Quality Standard in 2015, and the establishment of the National Air Quality Monitoring Network in 2016. These policies have resulted in significant improvements in air quality in China. For example, the average concentration of PM2.5 in China decreased by 32.9% from 2016 to 2019. The number of days with good air quality improved from 81.4% in 2017 to 88.8% in 2019. The number of days with heavy air pollution decreased from 27.1% in 2016 to 15.5% in 2019. The government has also adopted a number of measures to reduce emissions from industry, transportation, and other sources, such as the implementation of the ultra-low emission standards for vehicles in 2016 and the implementation of the coal-fired power plant emission standards in 2017. These measures have contributed to the improvement of air quality in China."
