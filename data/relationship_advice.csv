0,What could we do with a Reddit Community Funds Grant?,"Hello, everyone!

We are in the unique & exciting position to potentially be the recipient of a community grant from Reddit. We’re not sure if our application will be successful, or how much money we’ll get. But, we wanted your input since this will directly impact you, the user. 

Some give-away ideas we are tossing around:

-	One month of therapy from an online therapy source, such as Better Help.
-	A copy of a book on relationships from an author such as Kerry Cohen, who was our frequent guest during the Reddit Talks era
-	A game designed to help you and your partner grow closer 
-	Donating to a charity or charities voted on by our users, most likely ones that help victims of domestic violence, as we sadly saw an explosion of domestic violence-themed posts during the COVID-19 lockdowns. 


Again, I cannot guarantee our grant request will be successful but since this will directly impact you, we wanted to get your feedback. Please take a minute to fill out this survey. It's completely anonymous, neither myself or anyone else on the moderation/admin team will see who answered what.

I wanted also to take this time to thank all 8.87 (!) million of you! You are what makes this subreddit so amazing. We may not be the biggest subreddit, but I'd like to think we're the most caring. It is because of our amazing userbase that we're even being considered.","A Reddit Community Funds Grant could be used to fund a variety of projects related to the Reddit community, such as:

• Supporting the development of Reddit-related tools and services

• Offering grants to Redditors for research or projects related to Reddit

• Hosting events and meetups for Redditors

• Supporting Redditors in need through charitable donations

• Providing educational resources and support for Reddit users

• Funding research projects related to Reddit

• Promoting Reddit and its community through marketing campaigns"
1,Husband(37M) went through my(34F) phone while I was in a coma,He took fetish photos of your fucking mother. Come on now. You can't just suck this up.,"That is a very concerning situation. Depending on the context, it can be considered a violation of your privacy and trust. It is important to talk to your husband and explain why this was wrong and how it made you feel. If you are comfortable doing so, it may also be helpful to discuss any underlying issues that may have contributed to him feeling the need to do this."
2,My son (6m) found his dog dead at their dads (36m) house,"I think your concerns are valid and it would 100% be right to bring up your concerns with your ex. It might plant a seed that needs to be planted. I'd say have a conversation with him that goes something like this:

""Name, I'm VERY concerned about our dog (name). Given he was previously a very healthy, very loved dog, I'm concerned about how his life ended. I'm concerned that someone poisoned him - especially given he showed no indications of illness leading up to his passing.""",".

I am so sorry to hear that. It can be very difficult for a young child to understand death, so it is important to talk to him about what happened in an age appropriate way. Explain that the dog's body stopped working and that the dog is not coming back, but that the love he had for the dog will always remain. You can also help him express his feelings by encouraging him to draw or talk about his pet. Finally, it is important to provide him with comfort and reassurance that he is still loved and that you are there for him."
3,Husband (39m) makes me (41f) feel like a cheap whore,"He’s not moody, he’s manipulative. He’s selfish and immature. He has literally been dragging you all around too satisfy his need to be constantly stimulated. It sounds like he had impulse control issues. No, this is not normal. You know it’s not.","That is not acceptable behavior, and it is not okay for your husband to make you feel like that. If this is an ongoing problem, it's important to communicate this to him and seek help to resolve the issues."
4,How to avoid telling my (25f) best friend (25f) that her fiancé just died?,Make sure you talk to her family and medical team before going in the room with her. Just follow their lead.,"This is a very difficult and delicate situation. It's important to be honest and provide your friend with as much information as you can. However, it may be best to have someone else, such as a family member or close friend, deliver the news to your friend. It may also be beneficial to have someone there to provide emotional support for your friend in the immediate aftermath. In addition, it may be helpful to provide resources such as grief counseling services or support groups."
5,I'm 32/F not sure about this very bad argument with husband 33/M over sex.,"""...he really cares more about getting laid than my health?"" 

Yes, apparently he does. I'm so sorry.","This is a difficult situation, and it's important to remember that communication is key. It sounds like there is a lack of understanding between the two of you that needs to be addressed. It's important to take the time to listen to each other's perspectives and try to come to a compromise that works for both of you. 

It's also important to remember that sex is an important part of any relationship, and it's important to have an open and honest dialogue about it. It's possible that there are underlying issues that need to be addressed in order to make your relationship stronger. 

It may help to speak to a professional counselor or therapist to help both of you navigate this situation and come to a better understanding."
6,I (26f) don't want to be with my (24m) husband anymore and am considering divorce,"Stick to your guns, express that until you see change that is followed through to fruition, you are leaving because you rather your kids grow up in two happy households then one miserable household.

Sincerely 

A child who grew up in one miserably abusive house.","Divorce is a difficult decision and it's important to take your time to consider all of your options. If you are considering divorce, it's best to consult with a lawyer to understand your rights and obligations under the law. You may also want to consider counseling or therapy, as well as talking to family and friends who can provide support and guidance. Ultimately, it is your decision and you should make sure that you are making the decision that is best for you."
7,"I (40M) think my (40F) wife needs help, but refuses.","i would just like to say that you are washing your ass appropriately so dont worry about that! lol
seriously though she is so afraid of her own body she cannot even wash properly. that is unfortunate.","It can be difficult to help someone who does not want help. The best thing you can do is to be patient, understanding, and supportive. Try to talk with your wife openly and honestly about what she is going through and why she might be refusing help. Offer to be there for her and listen to her, and let her know that you are there for her no matter what. You might also want to consider talking to a professional counselor or therapist who can help her work through her issues in a safe and supportive environment."
8,My (20F) boyfriend (21M) told me that I’m disgusting.,"He’s intentionally breaking you down.  This is only going to get worse.  You’re only a year in, go find someone better","I'm sorry to hear that your boyfriend said such a hurtful thing to you. No one should ever make you feel like you are disgusting. It's important to remember that you are worthy of love and respect. If you feel comfortable doing so, I would encourage you to talk to your boyfriend about how his words made you feel. It's possible that he may not have meant what he said in the way that it came across. If he doesn't apologize, it might be worth considering if this is the kind of relationship you want to be in. Remember that you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness."
9,My (31F) husband (41M) is suddenly becoming more controlling and I’m not sure what to do.,His entitlement to your body would scare me. You are not safe if he genuinely believes what he’s saying. Divorce is definitely something to consider if he expects to use you at will whether or not you want it. *He is talking like a rapist*. If that does not disturb him you should be very scared.,"It can be difficult to navigate a situation like this, so it's important to take your time and think through your options. First, it's important to talk to your husband about what you are noticing and why it is making you feel uncomfortable. It's important to be honest and direct in your communication, and to express your feelings in a non-confrontational way. You can also seek out counseling or therapy to help you both work through any underlying issues that might be contributing to the change in behavior. Additionally, it might be helpful to look into resources that can provide support and guidance, such as a support group or a mental health provider. Ultimately, it's important to take care of yourself and to make sure that you are comfortable and safe in your relationship."
10,"I (28f) caught my boyfriend (31m) hand in hand with a girl, we’ve been together for 3 months","He’s already gone. Block him and move on. If he was concerned, he would’ve told you it wasn’t what it looked like and made up excuses.","I'm so sorry that you had to experience this. It sounds like a very difficult and painful situation. I think the best thing to do would be to talk to your boyfriend and find out what happened. It's important to get the full story before jumping to any conclusions. You deserve to be treated with respect and honesty in your relationship, so it's important to have this conversation."
11,"My (40F) husband (40M) plays this all-or-nothing game with me, and I’m wondering if this is a sign of abuse.","I think you’re asking a question that you already know the answer to because you’re hoping that somebody will convince you of the latter. At 40 years old, he’s not growing out of shit. 🤷‍♀️ 

He sounds like a major narcissist, and you definitely are settling right now babe..regardless of him having “good qualities“ , being verbally abusive, really just negates all of it, and makes him a POS. And the fact that your daughter is looking up to him as the man in her life when he is acting, so immature and ridiculous, is really sad, if you’re not going to leave for yourself, leave so that that’s not the type of example she has. 

I’m a mother myself and I left my ex because he didn’t do shit . And I didn’t want my son to grow up thinking that mommy was OK with doing everything and daddy didn’t have to do anything and he could grow up and be the same. 🤷‍♀️","It is difficult to answer this question without more information about the specific game your husband is playing with you. It is possible that this game could be a sign of abuse, especially if it involves manipulating or intimidating you in any way. If you feel like your husband is using this game to control you or make you feel bad, it is important to take the time to talk to him about it and to get help if needed. A professional counselor or therapist can help you both understand the dynamics of the game and how to address any potential issues."
12,My (29M) wife (32F) wants me to stay home all weekend while she works,"I'm so sorry about your friend and relative.

I'm going a different approach here, have you considered your wife's mental state and likely your own, you both sound burnt out. Your wife's reply about HAVING to do things before she can work maybe linked to OCD or a post partum issue, she has given birth twice in 2 years, that's alot.

I think you both need to organise some babysitting and take time to talk properly because you both can't go on like this.

Honestly good luck.","It sounds like your wife is very dedicated to her work and it's understandable that she wants to dedicate her weekends to it. However, it's also important to take time to spend with your spouse. Have you talked to your wife about this? Perhaps you can come up with a compromise that allows her to work while also giving you time to spend together. You could also look for ways to be productive together, such as working on a home project or taking a class. Ultimately, it's important to listen to each other and find a balance that works for your relationship."
13,Younger sibling (25F) is still living at home for free and has no plans to move out. My (28F) parents’ babying of her is legitimately turning her into a child again. She loves the attention and is ok with the situation. I think it’s weird and potentially detrimental. How do I navigate this?,"You don’t do anything.  And also, you don’t enable her yourself if your parents get tired of it and expect you to take over. 

It’s their bed, they need to lie in it. 

Carry on with your life.","It is understandable that you would find the situation uncomfortable and potentially detrimental. It sounds like you are looking for a way to navigate this without creating too much conflict. 

One way to approach this is to have a conversation with your parents and express your concerns. It is important to come to the conversation with an open mind and a willingness to listen to their perspective. Ask your parents what their intentions are in allowing your younger sibling to continue living at home for free. What are they hoping to achieve? 

It is also important to consider the perspective of your younger sibling. Ask her why she is okay with this situation and what she hopes to gain from it.

Ultimately, it is up to your parents to decide how to handle the situation. However, by having an open and honest conversation with them, you can help ensure that any decisions they make are based on a complete understanding of everyone's perspectives."
14,My (26F) boyfriend (28M) hid his sisters wedding from me,"Have you seen pics? He’s probably taken someone else as his date. Sorry OP, but him hiding it from you is shady.","That could be concerning, depending on the context. If he has a good reason for not wanting to share the information with you, then it’s probably not a big deal. However, if he is intentionally hiding it from you for no good reason, then it could be a sign that he doesn’t trust you or isn’t comfortable with you being part of his family’s life. It might be worth discussing with him to find out what is going on."
15,My (31F) husband (31M) won’t go to eye doctor that accepts his insurance because it’s “rude to the optometrist in Costco”,That Costco optometrist couldn't care less if your husband gets his eye exams from him or her,That's an interesting sentiment. Is there a particular reason why he thinks it's rude? It might be helpful to have a conversation about why he feels this way and explore some other options. Is there a specific optometrist he would like to see outside of Costco? Are there any other places that accept his insurance? It may be helpful to explore the options available to him and find a solution that works for both of you.
16,My(33m) girlfriend(26f) broke up with me because I wanted to wear a cat tail to a music festival.,"I kind of get where she was coming from. I don't think this one instance means she is controlling, I'd be embarrassed, too.

However, you do you. If she's embarrassed of you, then she's not the right person for you.",I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like she wasn't comfortable with your decision and felt like it was a dealbreaker for the relationship. It's understandable that she wouldn't want to be part of something that made her feel uncomfortable. It's important for relationships to have mutual respect and understanding.

This kind of behavior is unacceptable and it's important that your brother understands that. It's important to talk to him and let him know that this kind of behavior is not acceptable and that it was inappropriate. You should also talk to your wife and make sure that she is okay and that she feels safe.
18,Girlfriend 33F throws childish tantrums when I 29F bail on something due to feeling unwell,It's a pretty sad thing that a 33 year old woman can't go to the mall and buy a dress by herself.,It sounds like your girlfriend is not respecting your feelings and may be feeling frustrated or disappointed. It's important to communicate with her about why you need to cancel and express your feelings in a respectful way. You could try having a conversation with her to explain why you need to bail and to explain that it's not a personal attack on her. You could also suggest that you make plans to do something together at a later date.
19,Im 28F and my boyfriend is 33M. We’ve been together 2 years,"I’m genuinely curious why you stayed with someone once you realised he has no empathy? This isn’t a normal thing. Not all men act like this, I’ve personally  only ever been with one guy like this, he was my first proper relationship and I didn’t realise it was an immediate red flag. I think you’re drawn to the wrong kind of guys if you keep experiencing this. There are so many guys out there that are caring and sensitive to other people’s feelings. In a relationship, you shouldn’t be afraid to ask for support. I got diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis recently (at only 24yo) and my boyfriend has been nothing but supportive and loving, offering to do everything for me that I struggle with due to pain. You deserve better than someone who claims to love you but doesn’t support you in the slightest.","and are very happy. We both have very busy careers and hectic lives so it’s important to make time for each other and to find ways to stay connected. We enjoy going out to dinners, exploring new places, and just spending time together either at home or out and about. We also like to take time to talk about our days and share our thoughts and feelings with each other."
20,"My [28m] girlfriend [28f] texted her ex husband on their ""would be"" anniversary. Should I be concerned?","Dude I’m so sorry, but she was nowhere near ready to get into another relationship. There are some signs of that (like how quickly after the divorce she fell into a deep relationship) but ultimately I’m not trying to victim blame. She rushed and now she’s got cold feet and is rekindling with her ex.

You need to keep yourself safe. I know 6 months is a lot to lose but you’re just going to waste more if you stay.","Yes, it is reasonable to be concerned and to talk to your girlfriend about why she chose to text her ex-husband on that day. It is important to be open and honest with each other to maintain a healthy relationship. It may be helpful to discuss any feelings or memories that were stirred by the anniversary, and how best to move forward together."
21,My (33 F) husband (33 M) supported me in my dream and 13 years later I discovered his infidelity,"He supported you greatly for 13 years. From your post, I gathered, he was rather selfless about it, as he prioritised your dreams. This does not matter you owe him forgiveness for his affair, however I think that you at least shouldn't rush to make a decision on this.

&#x200B;

>In recent days he has been coming home early from work, he brings me flowers and chocolates. He initiates intimacy every night, (my libido is pretty high, but we only did it once a week because he was ""tired"").

Detestable example of love bombing. By the way, how long is it that he was ""tired"". He can claim this affair lasted only 5 months, but it is not like you can trust him right now.",".

I am so sorry to hear that your husband was unfaithful after so many years of support. It must be incredibly difficult to process these feelings of betrayal, hurt, and confusion. 

It is important to remember that you are not alone and that there are people and resources available to help you through this difficult time. It is important to take care of yourself and to reach out for support. Consider speaking to a therapist who can help you process your feelings and understand how to best move forward.

It is also important to remember that there is no timeline for healing. Give yourself the time and space to heal in a way that works for you. Remember that it is okay to feel whatever you are feeling and to talk to someone about it. 

Take care of yourself."
22,"I (M36) suspect my (F33) wife is cheating, while im deployed. Should I confront her? Or wait until I am back stateside?","\#1. I would hire a PI.

This is a serious accusation and you need to be 100% sure. 

If nothing comes off it, let it go. If your suspicion is correct:

\#2. Hire a lawyer who will lay out your option

\#3. Pick one of the options your lawyer laid out and carry it","It is always a difficult decision to make. Ultimately, the decision is yours, but it might be a good idea to wait until you are back stateside. This will give you a chance to talk to her in person and get a better sense of the situation. It is important to remember that any decision you make should be made with your best interests in mind."
23,My (30M) marriage with my wife (30F) isn’t going well. What should I do?,You've done all the right things and then some. Your marriage is going downhill and at this point I don't see any chance for improvement. Best to get out of it.,"The first step is to talk to your wife and be honest about how you are feeling. Communication is key to any successful relationship, and it's important that both of you are open and honest with each other. It may also be helpful to seek out professional counseling or marriage therapy. A trained professional can help you both identify areas of your relationship that may need work, and provide you with tools to help you both communicate better and work through any issues you may be having."
24,My (30F) husband (27M) cheated and now I’m friends with woman (27F) he cheated on me with,Please go to a therapist and evaluate what attracted you to this person. You can’t heal with the other woman because you two would be working against one another and there would be no progress due to the trauma bond. You don’t even love your husband you are simply experiencing withdrawal. Please maintain some distance and talk to a therapist and lawyer to dissolve your marriage. You deserve better.,"I understand that this is a difficult situation for you to be in. It must be a huge adjustment to be friends with someone who was involved in your husband’s infidelity. It can be challenging to maintain a relationship with someone who has hurt you in such a way, but it is possible. The best way to start is by having an honest and open conversation with the woman. Talk about your feelings, and try to understand why the cheating happened in the first place. It is important to remember that it takes two to tango and that your husband is as much to blame for the situation as she is. 

It is also important to take some time to reflect on your own feelings and boundaries and to figure out what you are comfortable with in terms of your relationship with this woman. It is okay to set limits on how much time you spend together, and it is okay to take some time for yourself to process your emotions.

At the end of the day, you are the only one who can decide what is best for you and how to move forward. It is important to take care of yourself and to make sure your needs are met first and foremost."
25,I 26m went through my gf’s 25f messages.,shes entertaining him. Break up.,"No, that is a violation of trust and privacy. Even if you are in a relationship, it is never okay to go through someone else's messages without their permission. Respect your partner's boundaries and privacy, and if you have any concerns or questions about their messages, talk to them directly."
26,My fiancé (29m) at at the strip club that my best friend (24f) works at?,At least she hit you up and told you,"Your fiancé being at the strip club that your best friend works at is a bit of a sticky situation. It's important to talk to your fiancé and best friend about this to make sure everyone is comfortable with the situation. You should also consider what your fiancé's intentions are in going to the club. You may also want to discuss with your best friend any boundaries or expectations that she has for your fiancé when he's at the club. Ultimately, it's important to make sure everyone involved is comfortable and respected."
27,My (27m) wife (25f) has been emotionally cheating on me with an ex bf.,"I would tell the gf and dump yours. They can have each other 🙄

Edit: sorry lol that but also seriously you deserve better, don’t take the bs but I’d also like to know if I were that girl",I am sorry to hear that. It is understandable that you feel hurt and betrayed. It is important that you talk to your wife about how you are feeling and what you need from her in order to move forward. It is also important to consider if you both need counseling to help you both work through this difficult situation.
28,(26M) Cheated and didn’t bother to explain. (23f),Best you found out now instead of another year later. Move on,Lied and refused to give an explanation.
29,(47M) confused about gf (39F) odd logic around splitting the bill for canceled accomodation,"So you could have gone on the trip on your own, as you originally intended, but you chose not to? If so, I can see her logic - since you were already planning to spend 280 without her, she only considers herself liable for half the additional cost. 

So the question is, why didn’t you go on your own? If it was at her request, she owes half of 354. But if you just soured on the trip on your own, it seems to me that she has a point.",It sounds like you and your girlfriend have had a disagreement around splitting the bill for the canceled accommodation. It's important to remember that relationships are about communication and compromise. It's worth taking the time to talk through the issue and try to come up with a solution that works for both of you. It might help to look at the situation objectively and think about what would be fair and reasonable for both of you.
30,Boyfriend (m32) flirting with (f18)?,"Are you sure you’re his girlfriend, and not her?","Flirting with an 18-year-old girl as a 32-year-old man can be a bit tricky. It's important to remember that she's still a minor and to be respectful of her age and boundaries. It's best to start out with light, playful banter and get a sense for her comfort level. If she seems receptive, then you can gradually increase the flirtation. Make sure to keep it appropriate and don't go overboard."
31,My (24f) boyfriend (23m) hasn't done anything for my bday 2 years in a row.,"This is your future if you stay with him. Dismal. It is a deal breaker for me. He is apathetic at best.

Does he do anything fun or spontaneous the rest of the year?","That's disappointing. It's understandable if he is busy or strapped for cash, but it's important to make sure that your birthday is a special day. Maybe you can talk to him about it and find out why he hasn't done anything for your birthday the last two years. It's possible that he just needs a reminder of how important it is to you, and that you would really appreciate it if he did something special for your birthday."
32,"In your opinion and experience, would it improve my parents' (54F and 55M) relationship if I (24F) and/or my brother (25M) moved out?",The key to any relationship is conversation. You should talk to them about it. We don’t know the context of arguments and frankly you probably don’t know all the details of their relationship. I would strongly suggest explaining all of this to them.,"In my opinion, it could improve your parents' relationship, but it would depend on the specifics of the situation. Moving out could provide your parents with more space and time for themselves, and it could also give them an opportunity to focus more on their relationship. However, if there are underlying issues in their relationship that need to be addressed, moving out may not be enough to solve them. It could help, but it's not a guarantee."
33,Bf (M27) and I (F27) have been together for 5 years and living together for 3. We talk about how much we want to have kids together almost everyday since we first got together. Cheating? Sorry for the long post.,"Get out of this messy ""relationship"" ASAP. 

He doesn't respect you. And yes, that's cheating.","No, it is not cheating to talk about wanting to have kids together. It is a normal part of a healthy and committed relationship. If either of you were actually cheating, then that would be a different story."
34,Ghosted by an old friend (M/26) that I don't have any drama with (F/26),"Question: when he said he was excited you were moving there, did he specifically say ""we should get together""?

My best guess so far is that he's either worried that his gf will not like you two hanging out, or she's even said that she's not ok with it. Whether you two are 100% platonic may not matter if that's a boundary she requires, unfortunately.","It can be disorienting and a bit confusing if an old friend ghosted you without any warning or explanation. It's natural to feel hurt and bewildered, even if you don't have any drama with them. If you want to reach out to them, try sending them a friendly message asking if everything is okay. Let them know that you noticed they have been distant lately and that you're open to hearing from them if they want to talk. If they don't respond, try to focus on yourself and the other relationships in your life that are positive and supportive."
35,My (29F) Wife (27F) Stayed Out for 5 Hours and Ruined Today,"You are right to be irritated, but you are wrong to sit around wasting your day- go out and do stuff. 

Put some water by the bed and go enjoy the day. When you get home, you can tell her that her being drunk and fighting is not enjoyable for you, and you aren't interesting in a relationship where that happens again. 

I get people getting drunk- been there myself- and sometimes it happens when we don't plan it (I've definitely had a hangover after 3 drinks and been like...what happened, I know my limit) But fighting is never okay, nor is keeping you up to fight, nor is keeping you up because she didn't have her key. 

So let her sleep off the hangover while you decide what you want to discuss with her about her behavior. Sure, people are late, sure people can get a little drunk, but it can't be a common occurrence and the 1 time it does happen, it should come with a big apology and then not happen again.","No one should ever stay out for such a long time without informing their partner. It is understandable that you are upset and frustrated about this, as trust and communication are important in any relationship.

It is important to talk to your wife about why she stayed out for so long and how it has impacted your relationship. Ask her to explain why she was out for so long and to explain why she didn't tell you ahead of time. This is an opportunity for you both to communicate openly and honestly about what happened and how you both feel.

It is also important to discuss how you both want to move forward and how to prevent this from happening again. It is important to come up with a plan of action that you both feel comfortable with.

Finally, it is important to make sure that you both take responsibility for your actions and that you both work together to rebuild trust in your relationship."
36,I'm (22F) Keeping My True Religious Beliefs a Secret from My Fiancé(23M),"There is nothing to compromise. He is clear about his needs and you are obscuring or lying about yours. 

Time to be completely honest. You can’t escape the truth and you both deserve clarity.","That must be very difficult for you. It can be hard to keep such an important part of your life a secret from someone you care about, especially when you are planning to get married. It is important to remember that you have the right to keep your religious beliefs to yourself, and you don't have to share them if you don't feel comfortable. However, it is important to be honest with your fiancé about why you are choosing to keep this part of your life private. You may want to consider talking to him about it and explaining your reasons for wanting to keep it a secret. You could also suggest that you both respect each other's beliefs and find a way to compromise."

38,Is my (26f) relationship with him (25m) just not working?,"You really buried the lede here... I can't believe you put up with his disgusting body-shaming.

Don't compare this relationship to your past ones. Just because it's 100x healthier doesn't mean it's _healthy_.

Being friends with exes is something I've seen done in healthy ways, and have seen done in unhealthy ways. But him inviting and reaching out to a woman who has actually tried to hook up with him while he's in a relationship with you speaks volumes. You've been clear that you expect him to set boundaries and he's steamrolled right over them. You really need to ask yourself why including this woman is more important to him than _your_ feelings and boundaries. He's not stupid - he knows how you feel. You've told him. He just doesn't care.

The whole kid discipline thing is another yikes from me. Can't comment much more but seems like a major incompatibility","It's difficult to answer this question without knowing more about your relationship. Every relationship is different, and what works for one couple may not work for another. You should talk to your partner to get a better idea of what is and isn't working in your relationship. If communication isn't working, it might be a good idea to consider couples counseling or other forms of therapy to help both of you work through any issues."

41,Update: My (F28) husband (M29) thinks I’m selfish for wanting to go to my brother’s out of state wedding.,">He grew up in an abusive household and says that that is to blame

I read an article from a domestic violence expert once. He was saying how pretty much every abusive man says that. His response is always something like, ""If you were abused, that makes your behavior even worse. You know what it feels like to be abused, so you have no excuse for doing it to somebody else."" After that, the abusers don't bring up their tragic childhoods again since they know it won't get them anywhere. 

>In the last week, I think he has made some meaningful changes

There's no such thing as making meaningful changes in one week. Changes that have only existed for one week are meaningless fluff. They have to last a long time before they mean anything. 

>There is no baseline to return to, we would be building it. 

Why would that be worthwhile? You'd essentially be starting a new relationship. If you have to start a new relationship, there's no point in doing it with someone you already know to be an ass. 

The fact is, he is not making these changes for your sake. He would have done it much earlier if it was for your sake. He's only doing it now that he is facing consequences. 

Think of it like... like taking good care of your car. You don't do it because you love or respect your car. You do it because, if you don't, your car might stop working, and that would be a pain in the ass for YOU. 

That's what your husband is doing right now. It would be very unpleasant and inconvenient for him him him him him if you left. 

And if you don't leave? This is what he'll learn: ""My wife is never gonna leave. She'll just pretend she's gonna leave, but that's bullshit. As long as I grovel, that idiot will come back. lol""","It sounds like you and your husband have different opinions about attending your brother’s wedding. It’s important to take into consideration both of your perspectives and come to a compromise that works for both of you. Have an open and honest conversation with your husband about why attending your brother’s wedding is important to you and try to come up with a solution that works for both of you. Perhaps you could attend the wedding for a few days and then come back home, or you could look into traveling options that are less expensive. Whatever you decide, it’s important to make sure that you both feel respected and that your feelings are taken into consideration."

It is important to pay attention to any signs that may indicate something is wrong, such as a lack of communication, increased tension, or a change in behavior. If you are concerned about your relationship, it is best to talk to your partner about it and try to work through any issues together. If you are still worried, it may be helpful to seek outside help from a therapist or counselor."
43,I am a (31F) who’s (34M) bf choose porn over having sex with me,"He’s repeatedly ignored your boundaries and lied to you. You know what to do next. He’s not going to change nor stop. He’s shown you who he is. If you’re fine with this, by all means, stick around for it. But he’s a porn addict, he needs to seek help.",".

I am sorry to hear that you are going through this difficult situation. It can be very difficult and hurtful when someone you love chooses something else over you. It is important to remember that it is not your fault and that you deserve to be respected and loved.

It may be helpful to talk to your partner about how you feel and try to understand why he is choosing porn over having sex with you. It could be that he is dealing with stress or anxiety and is using porn as a way to cope. It is also possible that he has an addiction to porn and may need professional help to overcome it.

Regardless of the reason, it is important for you to take care of yourself and set boundaries. If your partner is not willing to change his behavior, then it may be time to consider ending the relationship. It is important for you to be in a healthy relationship that is based on mutual respect and understanding."

That's understandable, but it's important to remember that it's not your fault. It's not always easy to know how to support someone in these situations, but here are a few things you can do to help.

First, talk to your girlfriend and ask her what she needs from you. She may need you to be more present when the family friend is around, or she may need you to be more vocal in standing up for her.

Second, talk to the family friend and let them know how their behavior is making your girlfriend feel. It may be difficult to do, but it is important to make sure that your girlfriend feels safe and respected.

Finally, consider talking to a therapist or counselor about how to better support your girlfriend in this situation. They can help you both to better understand what is going on and how to move forward."

It sounds like you're going through a really difficult time right now. It's normal to feel all sorts of emotions, including helplessness and confusion. It's okay to take some time to process your feelings and to grieve the end of the relationship.

Or did you just let him go without expressing your feelings?,"It's understandable to feel a bit hurt and resentful if your husband decided to go on a trip with his parents and their friends without you. It's important to remember that it's perfectly normal to have mixed feelings in these types of situations. It's also important to take a step back and recognize that your husband may have his own reasons for wanting to go on this trip with his parents and their friends.

It might be helpful to talk to your husband and ask him why he chose to go on this trip without you. This could help you better understand his motivations and help you to come to a better understanding of the situation. It could also be helpful to talk to someone close to you, such as a friend or family member, about how you're feeling.

Explain to her that her words and actions are hurtful and that you don't appreciate being treated in that way. It's also important to be clear about what kind of behavior you do and don't want to see from her. Let her know that you care about her and that you want to have a healthy and respectful relationship.
51,My [38F] fiancé [37M] only realized that he can’t find his passport the night before our honeymoon and now we can’t go.,"My partner didn’t look for his passport till the morning of our honey moon to France. 
It was 5.30 am. He couldn’t find it- he just had an expired one. 

To his shock I was pretty calm. I told him to go to the airport with me. They marked us as “arrived” but we weren’t allowed to board.  We then went straight to the passport office and stood outside the doors til they opened. Got an emergency passport by 12 noon. 

Then we rebooked the flight for the next day (because we turned up at the airport we actually were allowed to transfer with minimal extra costs). So we missed a day of our honey moon.

Edit:
We got an “urgent passport” not an emergency passport. At the time this happened they had a rapid access service - they did charge a priority processing fee.","I'm so sorry to hear that! That must be incredibly frustrating. Have you thought about looking into getting an emergency passport or other travel document so that you can still go on your honeymoon? It might be worth looking into, as it could be a way of salvaging your plans. In the meantime, it might be a good idea to start looking for a new honeymoon destination, just in case you can't get the passport in time. Good luck!"
52,I (36M) am unsure whether to repair my estranged relationship with my mother (60F),Let this lady go. Don't feel guilt. You've done nothing wrong. You will get pulled into her BS and you don't need that.,"This is a very personal decision to make, and only you can decide what is right for you. It is important to evaluate your own feelings and beliefs before making a decision. Think about how the relationship has been in the past, what kind of relationship you would like to have with your mother, and what kind of relationship you think is possible. Consider seeking advice from a trusted friend or family member or a professional counselor to help you weigh the pros and cons of repairing the relationship. Ultimately, the decision is yours to make, and it is important to be honest with yourself about what will make you feel most comfortable."
53,I (F29) refused to be in the family wedding photos from my boyfriend's (M39) brother?,"THe lack of communication is a problem. It was your boyfriend's responsibility to communicate with you what the expectations were AHEAD of time. It sounds like because you were uncomfortable you chose to be stand-offish. That is a bad look to others but somewhat understandable considering you weren't given any real communication about expectations.

Honestly? I think you need to move on. Your BF either sees you as a place holder or more as a convenience for him rather than someone with long term potential. The fact that after 2 years you didn't have anyone in his family's contact info, the fact that he thinks so little of you that he didn't feel the need to communicate critical details with you and then treated you like an afterthought... none of that is good.

At 29 you are in the prime of your youth (I say that in my late 40s). Enjoy the time with people who value you and WANT to build a life with you. Not compartmentalize you or treat you like an accessory. Please seriously consider what you want and how he treats you in all circumstances because this didn't come out of no where. My guess is there have been many previous instanes of him treating you like an inconvenience or an accessory.","It is understandable that you may not feel comfortable being in the family wedding photos from your boyfriend's brother. However, it is important to remember that your boyfriend and his brother have a close relationship and it would be respectful to consider his feelings in this situation. If you are not comfortable being in the photos, you could talk to your boyfriend and explain why. He may be able to provide some advice on how to best handle the situation. Ultimately, the decision to be in the photos or not is yours, and you should do what makes you feel most comfortable."
54,My fiancé left me- 30F and 35M,What exactly was said during those fights? Sometimes even one fight can be bad enough to break the relationship.,"I'm sorry to hear that. Breakups can be really tough, and it can take time to process the emotions that come with it. It might help to talk to a friend or family member about how you're feeling. You could also consider talking to a therapist or counselor if you feel like it would be beneficial. No matter what, it's important to take care of yourself during this difficult time."
55,"how do I (M24) best give, receive, and discuss advise with my Fiancee (F25)","You gotta decide when to let things go. 

I don’t really understand the fork example, cuz why would your feelings be hurt that she couldn’t open her fork?

For the eggs, you say (while she’s cracking them) “hey I like my eggs a little runnier”. Or (and I know this is a wild take), you cook the eggs how you like

My boyfriend also leaves lights on and it used to drive me nuts. Then I decided to choose to not let it drive me nuts. If he leaves a light on, and I’m the next person in the room, I simply ask him if he’s done in that room and turn the light off. The potential cost of nagging him to turn the lights off is far greater than just hitting the switch. 

The way he used to load the dishwasher would make me insane. I put all the forks together, all the spoons together, all the plates of the same size together, cuz it would make unloading it easier. He just throws everything in. And when I tried to micromanage him, he just gave me this look like I grew a second head. Do the dishes get clean his way? They sure do. Does it take me maybe an extra 10 seconds to unload the dishwasher his way? Sure. Is 10 seconds worth making my bf feel like I don’t appreciate him and don’t trust him to adult effectively? Absolutely not. 

You gotta ask yourself why you take it *so personally* when she does t hese things. Big things? Yeah, you absolutely need to talk about those in the moment. But little things? Just cuz she doesn’t do it *your* way doesn’t mean she does it wrong. She’s not your child, she doesn’t have to do it your way because you say so. You need to learn how to let shit go, otherwise you’re gonna make a mountain out of every tiny molehill until she decides she’s done cuz you do nothing but criticize her every move","M24: Communication is key when giving, receiving, and discussing advice with your Fiancee. Make sure to listen to each other, be respectful, and speak from a place of understanding. Take time to discuss and brainstorm solutions together. Additionally, it can be helpful to take breaks if the conversation becomes heated. Openly express your feelings and be honest about what you need or want. Finally, be supportive of each other and remember that you are a team working towards the same goal."

58,I think a girl (25F) likes my (27F) bf (28M),"This girl is being incredibly inappropriate, chasing down your boyfriend knowing he is dating you. I would have a serious talk with your boyfriend and try to set boundaries. Explain that you're uncomfortable with what this girl is doing and why. It also seems that her boyfriend deserves to know about this because this is also unfair to him. Regardless, I think your suspicions are spot on, and I think you would feel better talking to your boyfriend and coming up with a plan to address this problem so it doesn't continue.","If you think that a girl likes your boyfriend, it's important to talk to him about it. Ask him if he has noticed anything that makes you think she likes him. If he has, it's important to talk about how he feels about it and what he would like to do about it. It's also important to be honest with yourself about your feelings and how you would like to handle the situation. Communication is key in any relationship, and it's important to be open and honest with each other."
59,I (F23) caught my (M26) boyfriend messaging Snapchat pornstars? Is this a real thing????,"Yes he’s truthful as far as this is concerned 
Pornstars send nudes lately to generate impression for their only fans account and also to sell content 
They enjoy sending snaps to random friends and encouraging them to subscribe for more private content or premium content so I think he’s been truthful about that .","Yes, unfortunately this is a real thing. Unfortunately, it is all too common for people to be unfaithful in relationships and messaging pornstars on Snapchat is one of the ways people do this. It is important to talk to your boyfriend and address this issue. You may also want to consider seeking professional counseling to help you both work through this issue."

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/relationship_advice) if you have any questions or concerns.*","It's understandable that your boyfriend needs time for himself, especially if you are in a long-distance relationship. However, if he is not communicating with you for several days, that could be a sign that he is not prioritizing your relationship. It is important to have honest conversations about your needs and expectations in the relationship. You should also make sure that you are communicating with each other regularly, so that neither of you feels neglected."
61,My (26f) relationship ended because I don’t share the same passion for his (28m) hobbies.,"Personally I'd find it weird to have exactly the same interests and hobbies as my wife. We share some, but certainly not all... Her support of my interests is more than I could ever ask for and I'm very thankful for that.

Honestly I don't know the guy so can't say much. We can't force people to stay with us, but if he thinks he can find someone that will share his passions exactly and will be a good partner in all other aspects he's probably going to be disappointed.

Relationships are all about finding the common language and a compromise. He clearly doesn't think so.","Breakups are never easy, but it's important to recognize when your relationship is no longer working. It's clear that you and your partner have different interests and goals, and it's important to be honest with yourself about that. It's important to take the time to focus on yourself and your own passions in order to grow and move forward."
62,I'm [F24] very worried about my emotionally unstable friend's [F26] dating behavior. She wants to drop out of medical school to marry a guy she just met. What can I do to help her?,"You can express your concern but past that, there's really not much you can do.

She's an adult and no matter how ridiculous her decisions are, she's going to make them. You can't help someone that doesn't see anything wrong with their behavior.","First and foremost, it is important to make sure your friend feels heard and supported. Talk to her about her feelings and concerns, and let her know that you are there for her. Encourage her to talk to a mental health professional or even a trusted friend or family member who can provide an objective, unbiased opinion. If she still wants to pursue this relationship, suggest that she take some time to get to know her partner better before taking any drastic steps in the relationship. It may also be helpful to remind her of the potential consequences of dropping out of medical school and suggest other ways to pursue her career goals. Finally, remind her of your support and reiterate that you are always available to talk if she needs it."
63,How do I (22f) keep my bf (23m) and me from drifting apart?,He sounds like a wimp. Find somebody who helps your mental health.,"1. Make time for each other: Make sure that you both make time to spend together and connect with each other. Try scheduling regular dates or activities that you both enjoy.

2. Communicate regularly: Talk to each other about your feelings and what is going on in your lives. Make sure to listen to each other and be understanding.

3. Show appreciation: Make sure to show your appreciation for each other in small ways, like leaving notes or expressing your gratitude.

4. Spend quality time: Instead of just spending time together, make sure to make it quality time. Put away your phones and focus on each other, and make sure that you both feel heard and understood.

5. Stay connected: Even when you can't be together, make sure to stay connected by texting, calling, or video chatting."
64,My [21F] roommate and best friend [20F] won’t talk to my roommates [20F] and I after we had a discussion about her bf. I feel crazy and have no idea what to do.,"This won’t be the last time you experience this.  When some people get in a relationship they get so wrapped up in their partner and want to spend every minute with them.  That’s not a healthy way to have a relationship but it is how some people are.

You guys expressed you want to spend more time with her and she clearly doesn’t want to so make plans amongst yourselves.  The only point I think worth saying to her is that when you are planning a girls night in, she’s welcome to join you but that you prefer her boyfriend not be there during that time.

Unless they break up soon, I think your friendship is probably over.","First, it's important to recognize that this is a difficult situation. It's normal to feel frustrated and confused, and it can be difficult to know what to do in these kinds of situations.

I would start by trying to reach out to your roommate and best friend in a non-confrontational way. You could try sending her a text or an email expressing that you care about her and want to work through any issues together. Avoid accusing her of anything, and instead just express that you want to talk and work things out.

If she doesn't respond, you could also try talking to her in person. Make sure to give her space and let her know that you don't want to pressure her into anything.

If she still won't talk, it might be helpful to get a third party involved. Reach out to a mutual friend, someone you both trust, and ask them to help mediate the situation.

Finally, it's important to remember that communication is key. No matter how frustrated you may be, it's important to stay calm and respectful when talking to her. If you can do that, you may be able to work through the issue."
65,I (22M) don´t know how to tell my gf (19F) that I cheated on my last ExGF ?,"The way I see it you’ve got 1 of 2 options…

1). Continue to Lie. Hope that she doesn’t find out the truth. You already opened that door when you lied instead of being truthful, so, tough to walk it back now. 

2). Come clean. Face the possibility she drops you. Because, you lied. And, she probably lost a bit of trust. If you lied about that, she may wonder what else you would have lied about (the “Hickey” will look a lot worse for you now)

And then moving forward you have the standard 3rd option:

3). Don’t. Lie. Be. Honest.","It's important to be honest with your current girlfriend, but you should also be careful to consider how she will react and how she will feel. First, it's important to make sure that you're in a place in your relationship where you feel comfortable and safe to have this conversation, and that you don't feel like you're being forced to tell her. Once you feel ready, it's best to be direct and honest about what happened, but also to express your regret and remorse for what happened. You could also explain why it happened and what you learned from it that has made you a better person and partner."
66,My (M31) girlfriend (F28) does not feel the same anymore and it is hurting a lot. Please help?,,"I'm sorry to hear that you're going through this difficult situation. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of pain right now, and it's understandable that it can be hard to cope with. The first thing I would suggest is that you take some time to really process and understand your own feelings. It can be helpful to talk to a trusted friend or family member about how you're feeling, or to find a therapist to talk to. 

It can also be helpful to focus on your self-care. Take time to do things that make you happy and that bring you joy. This could be anything from going for a walk to listening to music to spending time with friends. Taking care of yourself is an important part of moving through this difficult time.

Finally, be gentle with yourself and remember that it's ok to feel whatever emotions come up. It's a normal part of the process. Allow yourself to sit in whatever emotions come up and know that it's ok to feel them. 

I hope this is helpful. Take care."
67,Boyfriend (24M) walked out of store on me when I (24F) asked for his help,"I'm just wondering why you're still with him. He's a selfish, inconsiderate asshole who has absolutely zero respect for you. Is he the only man left in town?","It sounds like there is some underlying tension between the two of you. It is difficult to know exactly what happened without more context, but it is clear that both of you need to talk about what happened. It could be that he was just feeling overwhelmed or that something else was going on. Either way, it is important that you communicate with each other to get to the bottom of why he walked out."
68,I (M30) saw something strange when sharing my location with my girlfriend (F26),"My partner and I (in our 40s) both share our location with a couple friends who live nearby, but both of them have their names saved. I also share with my mother and my best friend, who both live in a different city from me. Sharing with unsaved people seems weird, but maybe it’s an age thing?",She was surprised to see that I was somewhere she didn't expect me to be.
69,My (36M) bestfriend (also 36M) told me he's in love with me. I'm dating his sister (38F). What do I do ?,"Say thank you, I love you too, but not in that way, I'm straight and love your sister. We will always be best friends and one day brothers Inaw

EDIT: read it through again, say nothing for now, but monitor the situation, and somepoint make reference to that night and see what happens.

So either your friend is Bi or Gay and closeted or he's very lonely and in his drunk mind you are the most important person so acted out

Maybe mention to GF why does she think her brother is single? See if she says something she suspects","This is a difficult situation to be in. It's important to remember that you need to be honest with both your friend and his sister. You should talk to your friend first and explain that you appreciate his feelings but that you are in a committed relationship with his sister and that it wouldn't be fair to either of them to pursue a romantic relationship with him. You should also talk to his sister and explain the situation to her. You can let her know that you care about your friendship with her brother, but that your relationship is with her and that you are committed to it."
70,How do I get my (18m) ex (18f) to break up with their new boyfriend (18m),"You don’t break them up. You can’t control someone else’s actions. The best thing you can do is be a friend and hope that, if she is in a bad and abusive situation, she will realize it and leave.  

Don’t be pushy, don’t try to be a hero, just be a friend that she can go to if she needs to.","Unfortunately, it's not up to you to dictate who your ex dates. You can't force them to break up with their new boyfriend. The best thing you can do is focus on yourself and your own life. If you continue to be a good person and live your life to the fullest, they may eventually realize that they're better off without their new partner."
71,My wife [34F] and I [33M have a vacation planned but our marriage has been rocky.,"You're completely right.

Its hard to have a genuine vacation together when the foundation is unstable.

You'd essentially be faking your companionship. But what can you really do besides try and enjoying yourselves?

This trip seems like it will be a conclusion of things, for better or for worse.

To increase chances, maybe its best to be the bigger positive person always and attempt to make the most of it.

That way, by the end of it... You can confidently say:

>I tried my best effort to get along and clearly this isn't working out. I know we have a lot of things to sort out, but I figured with our trip, we could at least put all that behind us temporarily and enjoy each-others company again. 

If you feed into negativity, that will seal the fate here.","I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you two could benefit from some time away from the everyday stresses of life. Have you considered taking a couples retreat or counseling session while on vacation? Taking the time to focus on your relationship and address any issues can be helpful in getting back to a healthy place. Additionally, make sure you take some time to enjoy yourselves and have fun. Whether it's taking a day trip, going out to dinner, or just spending quality time together, it's important to reconnect and remember why you fell in love in the first place."

One way to start to move forward is to break down the situation into smaller steps. What is the first step you can take to start making progress?

73,Help... Had an affair with a lady at work. She's pregnant M/33 F/27,"Oh holy crap. You created this crap. What a child needs is 2 parents who love him and each other and in a perfect world wanted the baby.  What they don’t need is 2 parents that are you and her. First. Quit drinking. She didn’t make you an alcoholic. That’s not how it works. Best advice?  Get a lawyer. Absolutely be involved in your child’s life. Those are the only 2 sure things. If you want, get into couples counseling and start dating if you both want that. Don’t jump into a marriage because of this toxic mess. Time to start living with integrity. Both of you. A child can be just as damaged by growing up around chaos and resentment as they can by a situation where their parents are not together. Do not let her blackmail you into a marriage because it was your sperm that made it through. She does not have all the power here. You both need to get your acts together. Find a therapist. Yesterday. You don’t walk away because it always comes out. Kid gets hurt, finds out his blood type and realizes that dad didn’t want them. Don’t do that.","If you had an affair with a woman at work, it's important to think about the potential consequences of the situation. Depending on the laws in your country or state, you may be legally responsible for the pregnancy and the child. You should also consider the emotional consequences of the situation, as it could cause a rift between you and your partner, if you have one. It's important to be honest and open with the woman you had the affair with and to come to a decision together about the best way to move forward. Make sure to consider all of the potential outcomes of the situation before making any decisions."
74,My (22M) girlfriend (20F) sympathizes with a murderer because he's attractive,She sounds kinda dumb dude. Might be time to find someone else.,"That's an understandable reaction. It's natural to feel empathy for someone who looks attractive, even if they have committed a crime. However, it's important to remember that looks don't always equate to character, and it is important to remember that the person is still responsible for their actions. It is important to remind your girlfriend of the gravity of the situation and to be mindful of the potential consequences of sympathizing with a murderer."
75,The (M21) guy I’m seeing put a lingerie photo of me (F22) as his phone background,"So tell him. Some people like to show their girlfriends off, and some girlfriends like to be shown off. It's okay for you to feel differently, but assuming he should automatically know this without you telling him is plainly silly.

This is a good habit to get into in general. Every successful relationship in human history is based on two people who just _actually tell each other_ what they want and think and feel and need. So take this opportunity to attempt to have a successful relationship. =)",".

If you're uncomfortable with this, it's important to talk to him about it. Let him know that you don't feel comfortable with him having a lingerie photo of you as his phone background, and explain why. It's important to set boundaries in relationships, and it's up to you to make sure that your boundaries are respected. Additionally, if you're not comfortable with him having the photo, you can ask him to respect your wishes and remove it."

I can understand how difficult this situation can be. It sounds like there is a lot of stress and tension in your marriage, which can be very hard to handle. It is important to be honest with your spouse about your feelings and to try to find a way to communicate your needs and concerns. It is also important to explore why you are feeling this way. Perhaps there is a deeper issue that you need to address in order to find a way to work through this issue together. If you feel like you need help, it may be beneficial to seek out couples counseling or even individual therapy.

Here are some tips that may help:

1. Communicate openly and honestly - Talk to your partner about your trust issues and explain why you feel this way. Ask them to be patient, understanding, and supportive as you work through them together.

2. Establish boundaries - Discuss and agree to boundaries that respect each of your needs and wants. This will help to create a safe and secure environment for both of you.

3. Be honest with yourself - Reflect on the reasons why you have trust issues and work on understanding and resolving them.

4. Give your partner the benefit of the doubt - Remind yourself that your partner is likely not trying to hurt you and give them a chance to prove their trustworthiness.

5. Seek professional help - If your trust issues become too overwhelming, consider seeking help from a professional therapist or counselor. They can provide you with strategies to help you work through your trust issues and build a stronger relationship."

If the answer is yes, then the compromises are likely to be healthy in the long-term.

It's difficult to give advice on this without knowing more about the specifics of your relationship.

Make a note of everything - diarise dates, times, photos of any bruises or damage to belongings - and HIDE it where she can't find it.
This will help you when you decide your ready to leave the relationship. Create a new bank account she doesn't know about & move a small percentage of your funds into this each pay. Let a trusted friend or family member know whats been going on and help you plan your escape.
She will use her attorney mother for sure, she already is threatening you with it, but if you diarise EVERYTHING the truth will prevail.
Note also any bills you pay, items you purchase for the house, car payments, amounts you put into joint accounts. This will assist you with proof of contribution to relationship. And TAKE THIS WITH YOU when you leave.
Good luck!",".

My advice is to take some time to think about why this event or experience was so meaningful to you and to reflect on the lessons you learned from it. Write down your thoughts and feelings and consider how you can use them to make positive changes in your life. Also, try to find ways to celebrate and honor the experience, such as sharing it with friends, family, or even writing about it in a journal."
114,M/22 F/22 Really need any kind of positive advice please 💔,"I’m sorry you’re going through this.  A lot of young relationships simply don’t work out.  You need to get yourself a job and find a way to move out of your parents home.  Once you can show stability, you can get a lawyer to help you get a custody agreement in place.  In the meantime, keep visiting your child as often as you can.

Reach out to old friends if you can, or try joining a club for something you’re interested in where you can meet people that share your interest.  I’m sure you’ll make new friends that way.

When you’re ready, get yourself back in the dating game.

Don’t focus so much on the negative thoughts.  You still have your wonderful daughter.  You can do this!",It sounds like you're going through a difficult time right now. The best advice I can give you is to take things one day at a time and focus on the things in your life that you can control. Surround yourself with supportive friends and family who make you feel loved and valued. Take some time to practice self-care and do things that make you happy. Talk to a therapist if you need more support.

I am very sorry to hear that your girlfriend has gone missing. It is important that you take the necessary steps to find her as soon as possible. First, contact your local law enforcement agency and file a missing persons report. Make sure to provide them with as much information about her as possible, such as a description, her last known whereabouts, and any other relevant details. You should also reach out to her family and friends to see if they have any information. Once you have done this, you should also consider enlisting the help of a private investigator to help you search for her."

It doesn't necessarily mean that you are unhappy with your current relationship or that you want to be with your ex. Dreams can be caused by a variety of things, including stress, repressed emotions, or simply a way for your mind to process information.

It might be helpful to talk to your boyfriend about your dreams if it's causing you distress. He may be able to provide insight and reassurance. It's also important to take a step back and reflect on your current relationship and how it is fulfilling your needs. If you're feeling any doubts or insecurities, it's important to discuss those with your partner."

It's ultimately up to you to decide if you want to pursue a relationship with your ex. It's important to consider if they have changed and if you can trust them to be in a committed relationship.

While it may feel like there is nothing you can do, there are a few things you can do to help. First, talk to each of your friends separately and try to understand what is causing the strain in their relationship. Ask each of them how you can best support them during this difficult time. You can also offer to be a neutral third party for them to talk to if they need it. Finally, remind them of the things that they value in each other and the reasons why they care about each other. You may not be able to repair their relationship, but being a supportive friend may help them make the best decisions for themselves."
130,"My GF(F24) Cheated on me, and I (M24) don't know what I should do, Should I stay and try to fix the situation or leave?","Nope. She needs to go. She didn't just cheat once, she did it for 3 months straight. That is not a mistake it is a clear choice.

As for her depression, family life, etc. Not your problem and not an excuse for her behavior.","This is a very difficult and personal decision. It is important to take some time to consider all of your options before making any decisions. Talk to someone you trust, such as a close friend or family member, to get their opinion and support. Consider what your goals are for the relationship and if you think it is possible to achieve them. Ultimately, you want to make the best decision for yourself and your emotional wellbeing."
131,My (23f) boyfriend (27m) wants to go out drinking with his female coworkers,"He seems pretty open and communicative about it. He’s not hiding it. If you need more clarity on how you should feel, flip the players.

If you went out with 2 male coworkers, just to drink, would you be annoyed/put off if he was skeptical about it?","It is completely normal for your boyfriend to want to socialize with his coworkers outside of work. However, it is important to communicate openly and honestly with him and make sure that you both feel comfortable and secure in the relationship. If you are not comfortable with him going out drinking with his female coworkers, you should talk to him about it. You should also discuss the boundaries that you both feel comfortable with and ensure that you both feel respected and secure in the relationship."
132,Is it okay to tell my current partner (M22) that my (F22) ex cheated on me?,"I don't know who gave you that crappy advice but it's not true lol. People should 100% talk about their past relationships so their partner is better equipped to know why you behave and think the way you do in relationships.

You can tell him you have been in bad relationships where you were cheated on before, and it helped you learn new boundaries, self respect, and that you will never let a partner treat you that way again. That if anyone ever did that you would be gone immediately. It's healthy to discuss deal breakers with a partner though cheating should be common sense when in an exclusive relationship.","Yes, it is okay to tell your current partner about your ex cheating on you. It is important to be honest with your partner, especially when it comes to your past relationships. While it may be difficult to talk about, it is important that you do so in order to build trust and a strong foundation for your current relationship."

Also, age gap. Is he reaching out to other young women because he wants a harem of 21yds on rotation?",I understand that this situation can be very confusing and upsetting. It's important to take the time to process your feelings and talk to your boyfriend about what's going on. It's important to be clear about your expectations in the relationship and to have an open and honest conversation about the boundaries that you both want to set. You should also express your feelings and concerns about the situation. Ask him why he felt the need to reach out to these women and make it clear that this behavior is not acceptable. It's important to be firm in setting these boundaries and to make sure that he understands that this behavior is not okay.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/relationship_advice) if you have any questions or concerns.*","It can be difficult to understand someone else's feelings, especially when it comes to romantic relationships. The best way to start is by communicating openly and honestly with the person. Ask questions and listen to their answers. This will help you gain insight into how they are feeling and what they are thinking. Additionally, observe their behavior and take note of any changes that could indicate they are feeling differently. Finally, pay attention to your own feelings and emotions and how they might be influencing your interpretation of the situation."
135,"My(56f) husband (53m) married 7years, keeps just walking out on us without a word leaving his wedding ring…","This sounds exhausting and is emotional abuse. You've been quiet because he's in a strop, and that's your fault somehow? Have you been quiet because you are afraid of 'provoking' him? What would he have done if you had? 

This is unacceptable OP, and you should not be subject to it.","I'm so sorry to hear about your situation. It can be incredibly difficult and confusing to experience your partner just walking out without a word. It can feel like a deep betrayal and it can be really hard to make sense of. It's important to remember that it is not your fault.

It's important to take care of yourself in this difficult time and to reach out for support. You may want to talk to a therapist or a trusted friend or family member. It can also be helpful to join a support group to connect with others who may be experiencing a similar situation."
136,[TLDR] I (24M) am unsure if I’m being controlling or if I’m setting a boundary when I tell my (21F) partner that I don’t want her to hang out with guys 1 on 1 after 11pm. Am I in the wrong for telling her that if this persists I won’t want to have any form of relationship with her?,"Another thing, y’all aren’t dating, you two are friends. You don’t have any say or anything in what she does since y’all are just friends. It is also her “job” to respect you if she wants anything with you later on. I’d honestly still stand with my same response prior and move on, she’s obviously not going to respect your boundaries.","It's hard to say without knowing the full context of the situation, but it sounds like you may be trying to control your partner's behavior. If you're worried about her safety or the possibility of cheating, it's best to have an honest conversation about your concerns and come to an agreement together. However, if you're just trying to control her behavior because you don't trust her, then that is wrong and could lead to a toxic relationship."
137,I’m (23F) very shy/introverted and my boyfriend (26M) is the opposite,"Communication is key. Don’t push yourself too far out of your comfort zone, but do what you’re able to. Let your bf know your limits on what is comfortable for you so he can be in tune with your head space and vice versa",". We’ve been together for a year and a half and it’s been hard for me to open up to him. I’ve been trying to become more comfortable around him but it’s been a slow process.

That's understandable. It can take time to open up to someone, especially if you're not used to it. It's important to remember that it's ok to take your time and be comfortable with the pace.

One way to start is to start with small conversations. Talk about things you feel comfortable with, and as you open up more, you can move to more personal topics. It's also important to remember that your boyfriend is there to listen and support you, so don't be afraid to talk to him about your feelings and thoughts.

It might also help to plan activities together that you both enjoy. Doing something you both like can help you to feel more relaxed and open up more.

Finally, don't be too hard on yourself. It's ok to take your time in getting to know someone, and it's ok to be shy or introverted. Just remember to be patient with yourself and your boyfriend, and you'll be able to open up more in time."

Are you both getting what you want and need out of the relationship? If not, it may be time to move on.

If you decide that you want to stay in the relationship, it's important to have an honest conversation with your partner. Talk about your expectations and what you need from the relationship. If your partner is unwilling or unable to meet your needs, it may be time to end the relationship. 

No matter what you decide to do, it's important to take care of yourself first. Make sure you take time to focus on your own needs and happiness."

Talk to him about your feelings and let him know that there is potential for something more than just a friends with benefits relationship. If he is also interested, you can discuss what that would look like and how you both want to move forward."
142,(22M) thinking about ending things with (21F),"I think that sometimes we let go of a good thing because things slow down too much, there’s not enough excitement, things get boring. My bf and I broke up for a while because of that boredom, then came back to each other cause of the fact that there’s still a bond that deserves to be worked on. Talk to her-it’s the only way to get out of that rut. Believe me, I would know.","Ending things can be a difficult decision to make. It's important to talk to the 21F and express your feelings in a respectful, honest way. Be sure to listen to her perspective and be open to hearing her thoughts and feelings. It might be helpful to talk to a counselor or trusted friend to help you process your thoughts and feelings."
143,I (19M) started dating my classmate (20F) who had been in a 3 year Long distance relationship. NEED ADVICE,She seems super-keen which is both sweet and alarming. She’s been LDR for so long that she must be stoked to finally have dates and everything that goes with being in a proper IRL relationship. Stand your ground but don’t be an asshole about it. Go on the date. She might turn out to be the best decision you ever make. She might be crazy. You won’t know unless you buy a ticket and go on the ride.,"Relationships are difficult and long distance relationships can be even more so. It’s important to be respectful of your classmate’s feelings and remember that she may still be adjusting to the change in her relationship status. Be patient and understanding with her and be open to talking about her past relationship. Communication is key in any relationship, so make sure to listen to her and be honest with her about your feelings and expectations."

He considers you a friend. Period.

Nevertheless, being silly is your right.  
If you want to distance yourself, go ahead.  
You don't *owe* him an explanation. If you turn down his invites enough times, he'll eventually stop asking.","Yes, absolutely. It's important to be honest and direct when communicating with someone, and it's possible to do so in a way that doesn't come across as rude or hurtful. Start by expressing your appreciation for their friendship and thanking them for all the good times you've shared together. Then, explain your desire to focus on work and other activities outside of work, and let them know that you still value their friendship and would like to stay in touch. It's also important to keep an open dialogue and let them know that if their feelings change or if they need anything, you are there to help."

I'm pretty sure most people have instagram accounts and they follow people they know. It's not really much different than having a facebook account. He's not trying to hide it from you, quite the opposite.

This seems like you have insecurities that you need to work on.","It's totally understandable that you may feel a bit uneasy or even a little jealous if your partner has just opened an Instagram account.

It is also important to remember that if your relationship is strong, then there is no reason to feel threatened by this new development.

151,my (18f) is spending all my (19m) money,"Tell her you’re broke, then she’ll break up with you, then you’ll see her true worth and intentions.",It's not okay for you to spend someone else's money without their permission. You should talk to your 19m about your financial situation and see if there is a way you can work together to create a budget or find other ways to manage your finances.
152,What should I [28M ]do about my incompetent professor [42M]?,"You need to report all of this to everyone who will listen. It is so expensive to take any class, especially one in which you are expected to drop such a large amount on supplies you may or may not actively need. Then this teacher is clearly not teaching the topics you guys need to learn, straying off the subject and syllabus, then giving you the tests you are supposed to be taking for the class (so HE can meet some sort of guidelines for the curriculum) but hasn't properly set up any sort of lesson plan on the course material. I would be pissed and demand that we were allowed to retake the exams, and be given a teacher who actually knows how to teach. It is not enough for them to hire some tradesman with no teaching experience.

As far as I know, teachers are given a lesson plan based on the curriculum they are expected to provide to the class. Then the teachers are expected to formulate their own lesson plan based on this syllabus of curriculum, and can teach it however they wish, but they are expected to test and quiz on specific topics and such by a certain time.Clearly this guy doesn't know what he is doing. He isn't training employees on a job site- he is a teacher at a college who are charging their students a large sum of money to become certified in this trade, and there is a sort of trust between a college and it's students in which you shouldn't have to worry that this sort of thing could happen!

You should get together with some of the other students and all of you come together to the dean, or a student services advisor who can help you take the proper steps through the proper channels to take this on.

If you are allowed to voice record lessons for note taking purposes, do it, then use the recordings as examples of what's going on within the class. Show them your notes for what was taught prior to that test, and show them that he never even touched upon the course ,material that you guys were expected to be tested upon. 

It's not right and with the cost of schooling they better have teachers who are not only pros on their topics but *know how to teach students*. Get your parents involved if it doesn't seem to be going anywhere. The school is responsible for remedying this and if it goes unreported they cannot offer any solutions or fix the issues.","It can be difficult to handle an incompetent professor, but here are some steps you can take to try to improve the situation:

1. Talk to your professor. Try to have an honest and open conversation about the issues you're having. Explain your concerns and ask for solutions.

2. Speak to your department chair. If talking to your professor doesn't help, you could speak to your department chair. They may be able to provide advice or help you find a better professor for the course.

3. Seek academic help. If you're struggling with the course material, seek help from your school's academic support services. They may be able to provide tutoring or other resources to help you understand the material better.

4. Talk to other students. See if any of your peers are having the same issues. If so, you can work together to figure out solutions.

5. Change classes. If all else fails, you may want to consider switching to a different professor or class. This may be the best way to ensure you get the quality education you deserve."
153,My(22f) bf(23m) talks to his ex regularly and had kept this hidden.,"Life is too short to spend it on complicated relationships.

I never mess with people who are in contact with exes.

Can past relationships end civilly and maintain friendships? Absolutely.

However, there is the other side of the story where its a refusal to move on and residual feelings exist.

The juice ain't worth the squeeze.

Why bother dealing with a complicated relationship when you can invest elsewhere that doesn't include the ex complication...

If you're going to entertain a relationship where the ex is a prominent figure in your partners life... They best be bringing their A game and know how to navigate that with their new partner.

Doing this:

* Hiding things from your partner.
* Surprise! I am actually tight with my ex and you never knew it.
* I don't want to talk about this, gonna ignore you and go to bed.
* I made a sketchy environment and now I get pull the ""You don't trust me, you're the problem, you're just insecure"" card.

That shit doesn't work.

If you're involving yourself with someone whose close to an ex, you should be ensuring that your partner is transparent, and mature enough to understand the position they're putting you in, meanwhile knowing how to navigate it in order for you to be comfortable.

Shifting blame and guilting you into ""you don't trust me"" is not the approach here and is a red flag situation.

Life is too short and love is too valuable to waste it on complicated relationships like this.","I understand that this must have been difficult for you to learn. It's important to remember that this is not necessarily a reflection of how he feels about you. It's possible he just needs to talk to someone who understands him and his past. It's important to communicate openly and honestly with your partner, and if you have any concerns or questions about this situation, it's best to bring them up with him."

They say what you want to hear, so they can keep doing their substance of choice. Get yourself some hep and support. I hate to tell you, but this likely won't end the way you want.","1. Talk to him openly and honestly about the impact that his drinking is having on your relationship.

2. Encourage him to seek professional help from a licensed addiction counselor or therapist.

3. Offer him support and understanding, and be willing to listen to his concerns and feelings about his drinking.

4. Establish a system of rewards for his efforts to reduce or quit drinking.

5. Create an alcohol-free environment in your home, and encourage him to spend more time engaging in activities that don't involve alcohol.

6. Suggest alternatives to drinking, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time with friends and family.

7. Stay positive and be patient with him throughout his journey."

160,Long term relationship - end of the road? 31F 30M,"Old lady here. Been with my husband for 38 years now. There’s been plenty of times that our relationship kinda got in a groove of taking each other for granted and each of us focused on our own needs not being met, and that causing a cycle of blame and resentment. (You’re not meeting my needs, why should I meet yours). What worked for me was finally telling him that if I didn’t know him, and we had just started dating, I would have never continued the relationship. He felt the same way. So we made a conscious decision to treat each other as someone we wanted to date and give each other respect. Of course there will be times when one partner needs more support or attention due to life being filled with stress and changes. But it takes attention and involvement with each other on a daily basis to sustain a friendship and a marriage.","It's hard to say without knowing the details of your relationship. Generally speaking, if you feel like you've reached the end of the road, it's important to have an honest conversation with your partner to discuss why you feel that way and what can be done to try and save the relationship. If you decide that the relationship has indeed reached its end, it's important to do so in a respectful and understanding way."

First, it can help to take some time away from thinking about her. Try to focus on activities that make you feel good and occupy your time. Secondly, it may help to talk to a trusted friend or family member about your feelings. Finally, it can help to remind yourself of the reasons why it didn’t work out between you two, so that you don’t dwell on the good times."
164,I (F24) have been questioning my sexuality but have a BF (M27)?,"I don't think anyone on Reddit can give you a straight answer here, and anyone who claims to have it is lying.

Sexuality is weird. The question you have to ask yourself is, are you attracted to your boyfriend? You might be bisexual leaning towards women, you might be fully lesbian, only you can figure that out for yourself (maybe with the help of a therapist). If you enjoy having sex with your boyfriend, then there's no real reason to leave him. If you don't, they you should leave him since it's not fair to either of you.","It is completely normal to question and explore your sexuality, and it is important to be honest and open with yourself and your partner. It is important to have open and honest communication with your partner about your feelings and to be supportive of each other as you explore. It is also important to remember that sexuality can be fluid, and you may find that your feelings can change over time."

It sounds like your girlfriend is in a difficult place right now. It can be hard to find space to process our feelings and experiences when we are overwhelmed. It is important to validate her feelings and provide her with a safe space to express her emotions. It can be helpful to talk about her feelings, ideas for how to cope, and to help her find ways to better manage her stress. It might also be beneficial to seek professional help if her anger and irritability are becoming unmanageable."
166,"I (22M) needed advice moving on from my situationship (22F), what's happening?","You are both young.  Blocking and unblocking is incredibly immature.  Focus on your studies and have fun with friends.  If she ends up at your university and you guys want to try for a relationship at that point, then do so.  For now I think you’re better off not contacting her.","It can be hard to move on from a situationship, especially if you've become emotionally attached. The best thing you can do is to focus on yourself and work on improving your own life. Take some time to reflect on what you want and need from a relationship and set some boundaries for yourself so that you don't get hurt again. It's also important to take care of your mental and emotional wellbeing. Try to focus on activities that make you happy, like spending time with friends or taking up a new hobby. Lastly, don't be afraid to reach out to friends or family for help and support if you need it."
167,How do I (28F) break up with my cohabitating longterm boyfriend (30M) in the most sensitive way?,"If you trust that he won’t trash your stuff, video is a good idea. It’s going to hurt. That can’t be avoided. But doing this by video gives him the space to process without you and your parents there. It also gives him time to be elsewhere if he doesn’t want to face all of you. If there’s any chance that he’s abusive, forget everything I just said. Since I’m not hearing that, I won’t go into the way you leave if he’s abusive.","Breaking up with someone is never easy, especially when you’ve been living together for a long time. The best way to do it is to be honest and open with your partner. Talk to them about why you think it’s time to move on and make sure they understand that it’s not their fault. If you can, try to do it in person. Be prepared with the words you want to say and be aware of how they might be feeling. Offer them support and be kind. Listen to their feelings and don’t be afraid to express yours. It’s important to remember that you both deserve respect and kindness, even if the relationship isn’t going to continue."
168,I (19F) need advice on breaking up with my boyfriend (25M) of 10 months,"It sounds like, if I sum up your words in this post, like you don't see a future with him any longer. You can be in love and attracted to someone, but know that they're not the right fit for you. Don't beat yourself up about commitments you've made up until now - life changes, situations change, and feelings change. It's not like you haven't tried to have conversations about the things that aren't working, so no need to feel guilty (although I know, easier said than done). You're absolutely right that if you know you're no longer invested in the relationship, the right thing to do for you both is to end it. 

One thing you didn't mention was living arrangements - are you still living separately?","Breaking up can be a difficult process. It may be helpful for you to think about why you want to break up with your boyfriend. Are there specific reasons that have led to this decision? Knowing your reasons can help you have a more meaningful conversation with him. Once you have established your reasons, it is important to communicate your feelings to your boyfriend in a respectful and clear manner. It is also important to give him space to express his feelings and be open to his questions or opinions. It is best to have the conversation in person so that you can both be open and honest with each other. Lastly, it is important to be understanding and compassionate throughout the process."

You two have completely different views for relationships. 

Couples have fallen apart because one side asked to open the relationship up.

Knowing that your partner is capable of loving people outside of you, will be damaging for most people.

Don't force yourself to be in love with someone who doesn't view love the same way as you. You're setting yourself up for a rocky relationship.","That's a really big decision to make, and it's understandable that it's something you both need to discuss in more detail. It's important to make sure that both of you are on the same page about what this would mean for your relationship and your family dynamics.

If you are considering reaching out to the girl you emotionally cheated on, it is important to be honest with yourself about why you are doing so. Are you attempting to apologize for your actions and make amends, or are you hoping for something else?

It is important to think about how the girl may feel about the situation. If you are considering reaching out to her, it is important to be respectful and honest about your feelings and intentions. Consider writing a letter or email to her, expressing your feelings and apologizing for what you did. Consider also setting up a time to talk and listen to what she has to say.

It is important to approach the situation with humility and understanding, and to be prepared for the possibility that the girl may not be open to talking to you. It is also important to remember that it is ultimately up to the girl to decide what she is comfortable with and willing to do."

It can be difficult to handle a situation like this, especially if your partner had been drinking. It's important to talk to your partner about how they feel and what they would like to do about it.

Make an effort to communicate: Talk to your partner about your feelings and why you may be struggling to accept their love.

3. Seek professional help: If you find that you are still struggling to accept love from your partner, it may be beneficial to seek professional help, such as couples counseling.

I’m feeling very uncomfortable about the other day at the bar and feel as though you aren’t being entirely truthful. 

1. You told me at 1:00am that you were waiting for an Uber 
2. You then get home 2.5 hours later and tell me coworker A dropped you off . 
3. You then stated you never ordered an Uber although I have a text from you stating you were waiting for an Uber. 
4. You then changed your story the next day and told me coworker B took you home. 

So what is the story here. Everything’s extremely shady and I don’t know what is going on.","It can be difficult to handle this type of situation, especially when you feel betrayed. First, it's important to take a step back and try to take some deep breaths. If you can, try to talk to him calmly when he's sober. Explain how his actions made you feel and why it was wrong. Ask him to explain what happened and why he felt the need to lie to you. If he is willing to open up and take responsibility for his actions, then you can decide what the best way forward is. If he is not willing to talk or take responsibility, then it may be time to re-evaluate the relationship."

Acknowledge your own feelings and be honest with yourself about what went wrong in the relationship. Then, when you’re ready, reach out to your ex and express your desire to work on things and move forward. If they’re willing to talk, listen to what they have to say and be open to addressing their concerns.

The main focus of a business relationship is the business. The main focus of your relationship with your ex needs to be your child. If it doesn’t concern the child in some way, you two shouldn’t be discussing it. Set a parenting schedule that allow you both to spend equal time with the baby and hold him to it. Also, make a decision now about when it’s appropriate for new partners to be introduced to your child and whether or not the other parent should be informed of that meeting before it happens. 

Most importantly, take the time to forge your own path in life outside of being a mom. Whether it’s going to school or starting a business, do it. The more you develop your own personal identity, the more at peace you’ll feel about this breakup.","1. Acknowledge your feelings: It's important to recognize and accept your feelings about the situation. It's okay to feel sad, angry, hurt, or confused. Allow yourself to feel these emotions in a healthy way.

2. Talk to someone: Don't be afraid to reach out to a trusted friend or family member for support. Talking to someone can help you process your emotions and provide a much-needed listening ear.

3. Focus on self-care: Take some time for yourself. Spend time doing things that make you feel good or bring you joy. This could include taking a walk, reading a book, or spending time with friends.

4. Seek professional help: If you feel like you need additional support, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can provide insight and help you develop healthy coping strategies.

5. Establish boundaries: It's important to establish boundaries with your ex-partner. This will help you maintain a sense of control and respect.

6. Take care of your child: Although it can be difficult to co-parent with an ex-partner, it's important to make sure your child is taken care of. Focus on the well-being of your child and make sure their needs are met."

We’ve recently broken up for the final time and I’m trying to stay away from him.

The first and most important thing you can do is to create boundaries and stick to them. It’s important to be clear with yourself and with your ex about what kind of contact is acceptable and what isn’t. This could mean limiting your contact to only necessary communication, or even cutting off communication altogether. It might also be helpful to have a trusted friend or family member who you can talk to about your feelings and experiences.

It’s also important to take care of yourself during this time. Make sure you’re taking time to do things that make you feel good, like spending time with friends and family, taking part in activities you enjoy, and taking care of your physical and mental health.

Finally, if you find yourself struggling with your emotions, don’t hesitate to reach out for help. Talking to a therapist or counselor can be a great way to get the support you need to move forward in a healthy way."

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/relationship_advice) if you have any questions or concerns.*",It's important to be honest and direct when discussing things like this with your partner. Try to approach him in a calm and respectful way. Let him know that you care about him and the relationship and that your concerns come from a place of love. Explain to him why you're feeling unsure and ask him to talk to you openly about his feelings and actions so that you can both work together to rebuild trust.
201,Situation between me (19F) and my boyfriend (22M),"honestly I think a dude scrolling on instagram or youtube really doesnt care about any women he sees on there. It's like seeing women in a commercial or talking to the waitress at a restaurant. Even if he was like oh man im in love with angelina jolie or some shit like that, if he met her in real life he'd probably be like oh she's stuck up and cold hearted and she lame

&#x200B;

So you cant really take social media or internet pictures as like the be all end all lol",It sounds like your relationship with your boyfriend is going well. It's important to communicate openly and honestly with each other about your feelings and expectations. This will help ensure that your relationship continues to be healthy and successful. Make sure to take time to have fun together and enjoy each other's company. It's also important to respect each other's boundaries and make sure that you have time apart for yourself as well.
202,"I (21F) want to move in with my boyfriend (25M) but he says he's worried about ""alone time""","I don’t think he doesn’t want it. Moving in with someone is a big big step. Especially for someone who does value their alone time. 

Think of it like this… someone works or goes to school, or both. They’re busy throughout the week and perhaps being alone ‘recharges their batteries’ so to speak. Or the saying ‘it fills up their cup’ …alone time can be a form is self care. 

So he’s not sure if he’ll be able to have his alone time when fully living with someone. Perhaps if you move in together he can have an office space where he can go to be alone? Obviously he will have to be mindful that he’s not alone *all* the time though. 

I think having open and honest conversations about this topic will be helpful in making that big decision in the future when the time is right. 

You’ll need to respect his alone time, and he’ll need go respect you wanting to have ‘together time’ too.","It sounds like he is worried about losing some of the independence he has now that you are living together. It's important that both of you have your own time and space to do the things that make you happy. Maybe you can work out a compromise where you live together but also have some nights or days where you are apart. This way you can still spend time together, but also have some time to yourself."
203,"My partner [25M] thinks he's a narcissist. He's cheated, lied, and is unable to comfort me [25F] when I'm upset by his actions - but he's willing to work on himself and change.",Why would you want to be with someone who intentionally hurts you & doesn’t care that you are upset? I have no idea if therapy could ever fix him but wouldn’t you be happier with someone who cares about your feelings?,"That's great to hear that your partner is willing to work on himself to make changes. It can be difficult to recognize and admit that we have traits that need to be worked on. This willingness to learn and grow is a good first step.

It is important that you both seek out the help of a mental health professional. A therapist or counselor can help your partner to gain a better understanding of narcissism and to work on the underlying issues that have led to the behavior. It is also important to find a therapist who specializes in this area, as they will be able to provide the most effective treatment. Additionally, it may be helpful for you to have your own therapist to discuss your concerns and feelings.

It is also important that your partner takes responsibility for his actions and works to rebuild trust with you. This may include apologizing and taking accountability for his words and actions, as well as understanding the impact they had on you. He should also be willing to commit to honest communication and working together to create a healthier relationship.

Overall, it is important that you both take the necessary steps to ensure that you can both have a healthy relationship. With commitment and effort, it is possible to move forward and create a better future."
204,Is 20 too young? 20F / 21M,Wait until you’re 25 and your brains finish developing,"That depends on the context. In some cases, 20 may be too young, while in others it may be just the right age. It is important to consider the individual circumstances and maturity level of the person in question."

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/relationship_advice) if you have any questions or concerns.*","I can relate. It can be difficult to feel like you are giving more love than you are receiving. Have you talked to him about how you're feeling? That can be a good way to start a conversation and to see if there is something he is not expressing to you. It can also help to remember that love is not always expressed in the same way. People show love differently, so it's important to be understanding of how your partner expresses love."
206,My (25M) friendship with coworker (24F) is over and don't know what to do,"That ship has sailed, move on.","It can be difficult to know what to do when a friendship ends, especially if it is with a coworker. The most important thing to remember is that it is OK to feel whatever emotions come up. You may feel sad, frustrated, or even relieved. It is important to take some time to process your emotions and to accept that the friendship is over.

If you feel comfortable, it may be helpful to talk to your coworker about why the friendship ended and to express any feelings you may have. You may also find it helpful to talk to someone else, like a close friend or family member, about the situation.

Finally, it is important to remember that you can still be friendly and professional with your coworker. Even though the friendship is over, you will likely still need to interact with them in a professional setting. If you can, try your best to remain civil and respectful."
207,"4 bisexual people, (m18), (m18), (f18), (f18), love square if i’ve ever seen one, im in the worst possible position because no one wants me.",,"That sounds like a tough situation. It's understandable that it feels like no one wants you, but that doesn't have to be the case. There are plenty of people out there who are open to relationships with bisexual people and who would be willing to give you a chance. It's important to remember that there is someone out there for you, and it's worth exploring your options and putting yourself out there. You never know who you might find!"
208,(M28) I attract older women (F45) but they say I’m too young for them. What should I do?,"LOL,  Cougar tamer, plenty of them out there that don't have a problem with age, keep looking.","It can be difficult to navigate the age gap when it comes to relationships. It may be best to take a step back and focus on getting to know the person on a deeper level before jumping into a relationship. Ask questions about their interests, hobbies, and values to build a strong connection. Respect their boundaries and be patient. Show them that you can be mature and responsible, and that age doesn't have to be a barrier to a meaningful relationship."

210,My boyfriend ( 27 M) refuses to have sex with me (22 F),He needs some therapy on his own maybe couple later on. Some kind of deep rooted issues re: sex. Unless he's banging someone else.,"It is important to communicate openly and honestly with your partner about your wants and needs in the relationship. If he is refusing to have sex with you, it is important to talk to him and understand the reasons why. It could be that he is feeling anxious or uncomfortable about the situation, or that he has other concerns that are preventing him from wanting to engage in physical intimacy. It is important to talk through these issues together in order to come to a resolution that is comfortable and satisfactory for both of you."

First, make sure to communicate with your partner and listen to each other. Try to understand each other's perspectives and feelings. Spend quality time together and go out for dates.

If she has been hiding her feelings for your brother, it is likely that she has been feeling guilty or ashamed. It is important to talk to her in a non-judgmental way and give her a chance to explain her feelings. You may also want to consider talking to your brother about the situation if you feel comfortable doing so.

It is also important to be respectful of each other’s financial decisions and not to judge or criticize.

218,My (27f) partner (24f) of one year isn’t sure she likes me,"This is messed up. Sure you can have love for someone but dislike them as a person, like you would a family member or something- like your annoying great uncle. You would be sad if he died but you aren't actively in his life.

But for your girlfriend to think this? That's screwed up. What is she getting from the relationship if she doesn't particularly like you as a person and is basically dating other people? She is having her cake and eating it too in some way. Giving her gifts, spending money on her- perhaps the life you provide her is too tempting to hold onto so she keeps you hanging around while she's able to go out and pursue other people that she's actually attracted to.

Typically in poly relationships the belief is that you have a lot of love to give and do not wish to limit yourself to one person bc you do not believe in monogamy. But if she doesn't like you why is she even with you? I would 100% break things off with her, so that way you can focus on your own self and in the future find someone who puts as much time and effort into the relationship as you are.","anymore

It can be difficult to navigate when you feel like your partner may not be as interested in you as before. It is important to take the time to talk openly and honestly about what is going on in your relationship. Communication is key in any relationship, and it is important to be honest and open with each other about how you are feeling. Ask your partner what is going on and why she may not be feeling the same way about you anymore. Listen to her and try to understand her perspective. Be open to what she has to say, and try to come to a resolution that will work for both of you."

How about before you invite this man into your life full throttle. The two of you start small by working on reconnecting. 

I assume you have been getting along fine without him, right? So, if he is going to be coming back, it would be good to ensure that he is adding value to your life instead of being a burden.

Long-distance relationships are not easy, and they require a lot of effort and trust from both partners. Before making any decisions, it’s important to discuss your concerns openly and honestly with your girlfriend. Talk to her about what both of your expectations are for the relationship, and be honest about how you’re feeling. It’s also important to discuss how often you’ll be able to communicate with each other, and what kind of support you’ll be able to give each other while apart. Ultimately, it’s important to make sure that you’re both comfortable and on the same page with the decision."
232,"My (22F) boyfriend (25M) did not wait for me on a hike, is it fair to infer that he does not truly love me?","No, it just infers he’s a 25yo man-child.","No, it is not fair to infer that he does not truly love you based on one incident. It could be that he was simply running late or had to leave early. It is important to talk to him and get a better understanding of what happened. If he has been consistently not showing up when he says he will, then it may be worth considering if he truly loves you."

Even if you and your wife have different desires in this situation, it's still possible to reach a compromise. You could both agree to a temporary overseas assignment, or you could discuss different options for alternating between living overseas and living back at home. You could also explore ways to strengthen your relationship while living apart, such as through video calls or by visiting each other as often as possible. It's important to remember that no matter what, communication is key to a healthy relationship."
234,"I (23F) want to pursue a higher education and hopefully land a career, but my (24M) husband is completely against me studying or working.","Do you want to live your life?  Or live the life he wants you to live?

This is an incredibly difficult situation. It sounds like your husband is not being supportive of you or your goals, and that can be really disheartening. It can be hard to stand up for yourself and your goals when you feel like you’re being held back.

I would suggest having a conversation with your husband about your goals and why they are important to you. Explain to him that you want to pursue higher education and a career because it will help you reach your goals and contribute to your family’s wellbeing. You can also explain that having a career and higher education can help you feel more fulfilled.

It’s important to remember that you have the right to pursue your goals. Your husband may not understand why you want to do this, but you should try to make him see that it’s important to you. If you’re still feeling guilty about wanting to do something for yourself, then remember that you deserve to follow your dreams and reach your goals."

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/relationship_advice) if you have any questions or concerns.*","Relationship burnout can be a common problem in relationships, including those between an M35 and F32. This type of burnout can occur when one or both partners feel overwhelmed and exhausted by the relationship. It can lead to feelings of disconnection, loss of interest, and lack of motivation to make the relationship work. To prevent or reduce the chances of relationship burnout, it is important for both partners to take time to focus on their own needs and interests, and to communicate openly and honestly about their feelings and needs in the relationship. Additionally, it is important to make sure that both partners are taking responsibility for their own happiness and well-being, and to make time for activities that bring joy and satisfaction to both of them."
241,"My boyfriend (18M) took photos of me(19F) naked, while i was sleeping or unaware","While it is normal that your bf seems to love your body, it is certainly NOT normal to take a picture of you naked without your consent / awareness of it. 

I would definitely have a good talk with him and set some boundaries since he doesn't seem to understand that they exist. (laughing it off even)
Make clear that this should be the first and last time he's doing this. Hopefully, he will stop and apologize, and you can continue working on your relationship and be happy.

If not, I would truly reconsider continuing this relationship.",".

That is not okay. No one should take photos of someone without their knowledge or consent, regardless of the situation. You should talk to your boyfriend about this and explain that it was wrong and you don't feel comfortable with it. If he does not respect your boundaries, it may be time to reconsider the relationship."

The best way to handle this is to be open and honest with both your family and your fiance. Talk to them both separately and explain your fears and concerns. Let them know that you don't want to cause a rift between them, and that you would like to find a way to resolve any issues.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/relationship_advice) if you have any questions or concerns.*",No one can answer this question for you. You will need to talk to your boyfriend and decide for yourself if he is being faithful.
246,I (18F) broke up with my boyfriend (20M) because his family kept saying racial slurs,"""Leopards wouldn't eat MY face""- OP","I understand why you made that decision - no one should ever be subjected to racism or hate speech of any kind. It's important to stand up for yourself and your beliefs, and it sounds like you did that. I hope that in the future, your ex will take the time to educate himself and his family on why these comments are wrong and unacceptable."
247,My 29F Ex’s 31M wife is creeping my pages. My intuition is telling me he’s cheating on her and she’s looking for proof - would you reach out?,Not your circus not your monkeys. He's not cheating with you and that is a fire you want nothing to do with.,"No, I would not reach out. If your intuition is telling you that he is cheating, then it is best to leave it alone and not get involved. If you do reach out, it could put you in a difficult situation and could potentially create a lot of drama. It is best to let them handle their own issues and not get involved."
248,My [33F]Girlfriend with BPD hits me[27M] what should I do?,"You leave her, that's what you are doing.","It is never okay for your girlfriend to hit you. You should talk to her calmly and explain that it is not acceptable for her to hit you. If she does not stop, then you should consider seeking help from a counsellor or therapist who can help you both to understand and manage her Borderline Personality Disorder in a safe and healthy way."
249,My 25M bf states that he fell in love with (21F) my inside and not really the outside.,If you broke up already what’s the issue,That is a really sweet thing for your boyfriend to say! It shows that he values your personality and the connection you share more than your physical appearance. It also shows that he is mature and cares about your feelings. It's great to be with someone who appreciates you for who you are.
250,I (25M) broke up with my ex (24F) over the phone and I feel it was a bit rough. Is it a good idea to text them after?,"I think texting is a terrible idea.

If you have more to say, and it's meant to soften harsh things that were said earlier, the best approach is the old-fashioned letter (does not have to be hand-written).","It's really up to you and what you think is best. If you think that you should apologize for how the conversation went, then it may be a good idea to text them afterwards. If you think that it would just be stirring up more emotions, then it may be best to let things be. Ultimately, it's up to you and what you think is best."
251,I M21 don't know to proceed with F20 after confusing incidents,"You were being sensitive by unfollowing her but I think she just wants a fling. Not a bad thing but sounds like she likes you but wants to just have fun. If you have feelings for her then don’t be friends with her unless FWB.
I would at least do that just no feelings allowed","If you are having difficulty moving forward after confusing incidents, it is important to take some time for yourself to process the situation and gain clarity. It may be helpful to talk to a trusted friend or family member or to seek professional help from a counselor or therapist. Taking time to reflect on what happened and how you can move forward can help you gain the clarity and perspective you need to move forward."

Do you want to do something fun together? Maybe you could go out for dinner or a movie, or take a walk in the park. You could also invite her over to your place for a game night or watch a movie together. If you both like sports, you could go to a game or practice together.

Talk with your partner about what you feel comfortable doing and not doing during sex, and make sure they respect your boundaries. Additionally, focus on the present moment and take deep breaths if you start to feel overwhelmed. If possible, try to take breaks during sex to refocus and reconnect with your partner.

It sounds like you are feeling a lot of pain and anger about what happened. It is important to remember that it is not your fault that you were fired. The best way to get over your ex is to focus on yourself and to take time to heal. Start by taking care of your physical and mental health. Make sure you are getting enough rest, eating healthy, and engaging in activities that make you feel good. It is also important to find a support system. Talk to family and friends who can help you process your feelings and provide emotional support. Consider reaching out to a professional therapist who can help you work through your emotions.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/relationship_advice) if you have any questions or concerns.*","Moving on after a break-up can be difficult, especially when you still live together. Here are a few tips that can help:

1. Set boundaries. It’s important to be clear about what your expectations are for living together. Make sure you both agree on boundaries for the living space and for interactions.

2. Spend time apart. Make sure you’re both taking time away from each other to pursue your own interests and activities. This will help you both to focus on yourself and not be constantly reminded of the relationship.

3. Talk to a professional. If you need extra support, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can help you work through your feelings and create a plan for moving forward.

4. Focus on the future. It’s important to look forward and focus on the positive aspects of your life. Make plans for the future and start to make those plans a reality.

5. Get support. It’s important to have a supportive network of friends and family who can help you through this difficult time. Let them know what you’re going through and talk to them about your feelings."
264,I [36m] feel like I am quiet quitting my marriage to my wife [34f] and it is heartbreaking.,"I think it’s important to have a conversation with her about exactly how she’s going to fix this issue. What brings on these outbursts? Can she promise and commit to going to therapy? Anger management classes? Those would help her find healthy coping mechanisms. You shouldn’t just sit around in fear, waiting for her to explode. She should be giving you assurances that it won’t happen again, by actively and visibly putting the work in. Maybe if you explain the context of why you’re distancing yourself as you explained in your post, she will be motivated to actually work on it.","I understand how difficult this must be for you. It's normal to feel a range of emotions when making such a big decision. Have you spoken with your wife about your feelings? It may be helpful to have an honest conversation about why you feel like you need to quit your marriage. It's important to be open and honest with each other and to try and understand each other's point of view. If you need support during this difficult time, please consider reaching out to a counselor or therapist who can provide guidance and help you process your emotions."

268,I think me (18M) and my girlfriend (18F) rushed into a relationship. How do I know if I'm overthinking?,"Meh whatever bro.

We have all done something like that before.

Saying I love you after your 4th kiss, yup that is rapid pace.

But you two laughed it off and moved on from it.

Didn't seem to create a massive rift in your connection.

You were just expressing your infatuation and maybe could have used different words to communicate it.

But whatever, there are worse things you could have done.

As long as it didn't break your connection and cause her to withdrawal, just continue to develop your connection.

Your friend is sending you down rabbit holes that you don't need to be going down.

You and your GF are both 18... Your friend is likely also 18... He probably doesn't have a clue to what he is talking about himself.

This is apart of your youth. Falling in love and figuring shit out as you go.

Do you think your friend knows better than you?

He doesn't.

Neither of you do (no offence). And only through your experiences (this girl you're with) will you learn these type of things.

So, fall in love.

Do stupid shit.

Make mistakes.

Learn.

Develop.

That is what you're doing right now.

Learn to trust your own judgment over others.","One way to know if you’re overthinking a situation is to take a step back and look at it objectively. Ask yourself if your concerns are based in reality or if they are based in fear or insecurity. If you can’t answer these questions, it might be helpful to talk to a trusted friend or family member and get their perspective. Additionally, you and your girlfriend can also talk about your feelings and concerns openly and honestly with each other. This can help you both gain a better understanding of the situation and make sure your relationship is built on a solid foundation."

However, if she has started to act differently around you, such as blushing when you talk, making a lot of eye contact, or being extra flirty or touchy, these could be signs that she may have feelings for you. Ultimately, the only way to know for sure is to talk to her about it."
281,Me (M20) and my girlfriend (F20) haven’t ben intimate in a year,"It looks like your girlfriend is a poor listener. You have tried to make an effort in multiple ways to not only express to her how you feel about the lack of intimacy, but to also try to find solutions, all of which she continually shuts down. It's selfish of her to act like your concerns are ""weird for making a problem out of it"", bc a 2 yr relationship, when things should be only getting stronger and so close to that honeymoon phase we all talk about, shouldn't have such a lack of intimacy as if you guys are an old married couple with a sexless relationship or something.

If you really want some answers you gotta hold her feet to the metaphorical sex flame. Tell her something like ""Look, we gotta talk. I have tried on several occasions to tell you that I need more from this relationship and have tried to make efforts to fix our intimacy issues- which are an issue, at least for me. Either we need to both be making more of an effort or I do not see the point in dragging this relationship out."" If you crave something your partner is not giving you it is your job to express that then give your partner a little bit of time to remedy their behavior. If she doesn't then you can at least say that you tried to communicate with her, and feel good about breaking things off with her if things do not improve.

Just because she doesn't see a problem with it doesn't mean your opinions aren't valid. Does she have any reasons for why she doesn't pursue or seem to enjoy sex? Does she have a low sex drive, or some sort of past traumas involving sexual relationships in her past? It is worth delving into if she will talk with you about it, but if she keeps shrugging it off or calls you weird, which is a real negative ass way to talk to someone you supposedly love, then she's not the one for you.","It sounds like you and your girlfriend are not feeling as connected as you used to be. Intimacy is an important part of any relationship, so it's important to talk about why you two haven't been as intimate lately. Communication is key when it comes to understanding each other's needs and desires, so it may be helpful to sit down and talk about what is keeping you two from being intimate. It may be helpful to take things slow and start with simple physical touches like holding hands or hugging. It's important to take the time to reconnect with each other and build up the trust and intimacy again."

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/relationship_advice) if you have any questions or concerns.*","It is difficult to answer this question without knowing the details of the lie, but it is important to remember that lying is never okay and your reaction should reflect that. You should express your feelings of hurt, anger, and betrayal and let your fiance know that you expect honesty and transparency in your relationship. You should also ask for an explanation and give them an opportunity to explain why they lied. If they are willing to accept responsibility for their actions and apologize, then it may be possible to move forward. However, if they are not willing to take responsibility or admit their mistake, then it may be best to reconsider the relationship."
284,I[24M] kissed my Ex[22F],"You broke the rules. You would be breaking them again by trying to get her to talk when she doesn’t want to. I think it’s incredibly hard to go straight from relationship to friendship. Sometimes usually still has feelings and well, you know all about that. Question. What would you be fighting for?",I'm sorry to hear that. It's important to remember that it's best to move on and focus on the future rather than the past.
285,I [24F] want a guy [30M] to see me as GF material and not just a bootycall,"You can ask him if he wants to be more serious but past that, there's not much else you can do. You can't MAKE someone see you as a girlfriend if they aren't interested.","If you want a guy to see you as GF material and not just a bootycall, then you need to make sure that you are showing him that you are interested in a serious, committed relationship. Talk to him about your goals and aspirations for the future, and let him know that you are looking for something more than a casual fling. Show him that you are interested in getting to know him on a deeper level, not just in physical intimacy. Show him that you are reliable, trustworthy, and dependable. Be yourself, and let him get to know the real you. Show him that you are willing to invest time and effort into developing a meaningful relationship with him."
286,My (F29) friends (F28) GF (F32) is jealous of me. Do I confront her?,"Ignore it. That’s her girlfriend, not yours. Just cut as wide a berth as you can around her and brush off the rest. Her feelings about your friendship aren’t relevant to you. If it reaches a head, they can talk it out.","It can be difficult to confront someone who is feeling jealous of you, as it can make the situation more awkward or uncomfortable for both of you. It may be best to talk to your friend first and ask them what is going on. They may be able to provide more insight into the situation and help you decide the best way to handle it."
287,Is a 27F being with a 19M okay if you’re in the same spots in life?,"That’s concerning and yes, the age gap is too big. The priority should be for you to play catch up by focusing on yourself.","Yes, it is okay for a 27F to be with a 19M if they are in the same spots in life. Ultimately, it depends on the individuals involved and their compatibility. If they are both mature and share similar interests, values, and goals, then it could be a successful relationship."
288,All my (19F) boyfriend’s (21M) friends are cheaters and they’re all going on a trip together next weekend. How can I be less insecure about this?,"I dunno darling, but I agree you are the company you keep. If he’s willing to watch his friends cheat over and over, he probably doesn’t have a problem with it.

Set your boundaries, make them clear. I know you say you “trust” him but if you’re panicked about it, your gut is telling you something else","It's understandable to feel insecure when you know that your partner's friends are cheaters. It can be difficult to trust them when you know that they have engaged in this kind of behavior.

One way to manage your insecurity is to make sure that you and your partner have clear boundaries and expectations when it comes to his friends and their behavior. Talk to your partner about how you feel and make sure that he is aware of your concerns. Let him know that you don't want him engaging in any activities that could be considered cheating while he is away.

You can also try to focus on the positive aspects of the trip. Talk to your partner about all the exciting things he will get to see and do while he is away, and remind him that you will be waiting for him when he returns.

Finally, try to practice self-care and focus on activities that make you feel good. Spend time with friends and family, take up a new hobby, or engage in whatever activities help you to relax and feel more secure."
289,I'm 30m and my girlfriend 20f is weirdly jealous of ugly women,"Your GF has low self esteem and thinks she's as ugly as the woman in the wheelchair so she thinks you would leave her for someone else ""of the same caliber."" She's not threatened by the pretty one because she thinks you have a ""type."" It's a complete low self esteem issues.",Jealousy can be a tricky emotion to navigate. It is important to talk to your girlfriend about her feelings and try to understand why she is feeling jealous. It may be helpful to talk to her about what triggers her jealousy and how you can both work together to manage it.
290,i (20F) keep having nightmares about my boyfriend (30M) leaving/cheating on me. why is this happening?,Cause he’s 10 years older than you.  You’re a child dating an adult.  Why do you think any **30 year old** is with someone a while 10 years younger than them?  Y’all almost weren’t even in school at the same time.,"It's hard to say why you're having these nightmares without knowing more about your relationship. However, it's possible that your subconscious is simply reflecting your fears and worries about your relationship. Maybe you're feeling insecure or anxious about the future of your relationship, and your mind is manifesting these worries in your dreams. It could also be that you're feeling overwhelmed by the current state of your relationship, and your mind is trying to work through these feelings. It's important to talk to your boyfriend about your fears and worries to make sure that you're both on the same page."
291,"I (37F) am Feeling bullied in house-share with (34F),(33F), how can I live here for another 6 months?","Keep doing what you’re doing. No more WhatsApp. She needs to act like an adult and speak directly. If she/they leave the kitchen a mess, don’t clean it for them and consider snapping a photo for the next time she approaches you about cleaning. Save as much as you can for a down payment to get your own place in 6 months. Having a goal like that to focus on may help you get through the time more easily.","1. Talk to your housemates. It's important to communicate your feelings and try to work out a solution. Explain why you feel like you're being bullied, and ask them to be more mindful of your feelings going forward.

2. Set boundaries. Make sure you are clear about what is and isn't acceptable behavior. Establish your own rules and stick to them.

3. Avoid their company. If there are certain people in the house that you don't get along with, try to avoid them as much as possible. Spend time in other areas of the house or find ways to occupy yourself when they are around.

4. Seek support. Reach out to friends and family for emotional support. It may also be helpful to talk to a counselor or therapist if you feel like you need extra help in dealing with the situation.

5. Document everything. Keeping a record of any incidents or conversations can be beneficial in the event that the situation escalates and you need to take action."

No, that was wrong of you to do, and it's not a good idea to confront him about it. It's likely that it will only lead to more hurt and mistrust.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/relationship_advice) if you have any questions or concerns.*","This could mean a variety of things, depending on the context. It could suggest that the person is not fully invested in the present moment, or that they are comparing the current experience to a past one. It could also suggest that the person is trying to evoke a specific response from their partner. Ultimately, it is important to communicate openly and honestly about these feelings in order to gain a better understanding of what is going on."
303,Am I (20F) asking too much of my (19F) gf to be more considerate?,"It sounds like you are in a challenging situation with your girlfriend, where you feel like she can be inconsiderate towards your feelings. Communication plays a crucial role in any relationship, and it's important for both partners to listen and validate each other's emotions. However, it seems like this issue has brought up some misunderstandings and frustrations between you two. It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your concerns, expressing your feelings without blaming or attacking her. This can create an opportunity for both of you to better understand each other's perspectives and find a healthy resolution.","No, you are not asking too much. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and consideration. You can talk to your girlfriend about how you would like her to be more considerate, and if she is willing to listen and try to make changes then it is definitely worth a try. However, if she is not willing to make any changes or refuses to listen, then it may be time to consider whether or not the relationship is right for you."
304,I think of another man while I’m in a relationship. (24F) (26M),I think you should seek professional help for your problems...whatever  they may be.,"That is something only you can answer. It is not uncommon to think of other people when in a relationship, but if you find yourself obsessing over someone else and it is taking away from your current relationship, it may be time to re-evaluate the relationship and decide if it is healthy for you."

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/relationship_advice) if you have any questions or concerns.*","It can be difficult to have doubts about a relationship, especially when it's with someone you care about. If you're feeling unsure, it's important to take the time to talk to your girlfriend about your concerns. Try to be open and honest about your feelings and listen to what she has to say. You can also think about what you want out of the relationship and decide if it's something that you both can work towards. If you feel like the relationship isn't working, it may be time to consider if it's the right one for you."
306,My bf (M/22) won’t forgive me (F/33) should we break up?,Why are you engaged to a 22 year old who doesn’t even live near you? Definitely break up,"No, you should not break up yet. It is important to talk to him about what is going on and why he is not willing to forgive you. It is possible that he may need time to process the situation, but it is important to have an open and honest conversation to try and work things out."
307,I (18M) don’t make my GF (18F) feel special,"A reality check is required.

It may be too late to fix this sort of thing.

The other persons perception of you and how they think you view them... Is insanely fragile. If you drop the ball on that, it can be a no coming back from kind of deal. And yes, something as liking other woman's (assuming thirst trap) posts, can trigger it.

Seeing your partner desire other people cuts very deep for the other person.

If you're 5 months in and already struggling to keep your relationship together... Might be better to let things fall apart and move onto something new where this complication doesn't exist. 

Not a whole lot you can do when the other person is always assuming you're going to cheat.

Right now, you can issue another heart felt apology and tell her that you didn't fully realize how hurtful your actions where if she is still affected by it months later.

If this continues to exist, there is no point in dragging out a 5 month relationship for another 2 years trying to make something broken work.","It sounds like you want to make your girlfriend feel special, so the best thing to do is to take the time to show her that you care. Start by showing your appreciation for her. Compliment her on the things she does and say how much you appreciate all that she does for you. Give her thoughtful gifts that she will enjoy, or take her out on special dates. Spend quality time together, talking and listening to each other. Show her that you are interested in her and that you value her opinions and feelings. Doing these things will help her to feel special and appreciated."

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/relationship_advice) if you have any questions or concerns.*","That's a tough question to answer without knowing more about your relationship. It's important to remember that relationships take work, and that feeling unloved is not a good thing. It's important to communicate with your partner and make sure that you both feel loved and supported in the relationship. If you're not getting the support and love you need, it might be time to consider whether it's the right relationship for you."
310,"Suddenly fallen out of love with boyfriend M26, me F25","We can’t be your therapist, and it sounds like you need one. But from a relationship advice standpoint you’re intentionally hiding things from him, by your own admission, and you will sabotage 100% of your relationships by doing that. If you want to change that but don’t know how, again, therapy.","It can be difficult to process when you suddenly fall out of love with a partner. It is important to take some time to focus on yourself and take care of your own emotional needs. It can be helpful to talk to a trusted friend, family member, or counselor about your feelings. You may also want to take some time to reflect on the relationship and what could have contributed to the sudden shift in your feelings. It is important to be honest and open with your partner about how you are feeling so that you can both work together to decide what the best next step is for the relationship."
311,I (34M) am devastated my wife (F44) and I may not be able to have kids. How do I get over this?,"She did want a child with you. YOU passed on that opportunity because you “weren’t ready” when it was still a viable option, and now that she’s been through 4 years of hell, you’re the victim because years of medical torture isn’t “exciting” for her? My heart breaks for your poor wife. 

Look into egg donation and surrogacy if propagating your genes matters that much to you. Otherwise, accept the fact that you’re the one who closed the window on having a child and stop making your wife feel like shit over your fuck-up.","It's understandable that you would be feeling devastated about this potential situation. It's important to give yourself time to grieve and to accept the situation if it is the reality. Acknowledge your feelings and find ways to express them. Talk to your wife about how you're feeling and work together to find ways to cope. Reach out to a therapist if you need additional support. Additionally, think about ways you can still find joy and purpose in life. Consider exploring new hobbies, spending more time with friends and family, and finding ways to give back to your community."

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/relationship_advice) if you have any questions or concerns.*","Ending a friendship is never easy. Before you make any decisions, it is important to think about why you feel like ending the friendship is the right thing to do. Are there any underlying issues that you feel are causing the friendship to become strained? If so, can you talk to your friend about them and work on resolving them together? If not, or if the issues are too big to overcome, then it may be best to accept that the friendship has run its course and end it. It is important to remember that it is okay to take a break from a friendship if it is no longer working, and that it is possible to still care about someone and not be friends with them."
313,My GF (27F) always wants to go do something fun but gets annoyed with the options I (25M) give her. It’s frustrating me. What should I do?,It’s Sunday what else is there to do besides watching 10 hours of football,"First, talk to your girlfriend and ask her what she would like to do. Maybe she has some ideas that she hasn't shared with you yet. Ask her what kind of activities she likes and see if there are any that you can both agree on. Additionally, you can look online for fun activities in your area and suggest those to her. You could also try to compromise by alternating between activities she wants to do and activities you want to do. Ultimately, communication is key in any relationship so make sure you are both listening to each other and being open to new ideas."
314,My bf (30M) and I (29F) are considering sex therapy. I’m feeling scared to try and need advice.,How about he just gets some regular therapy,"It can be intimidating to try something new, especially something as intimate as sex therapy. However, it can also be a very rewarding experience. The first step is to talk to your partner about your concerns and fears. Ask them what they hope to gain from sex therapy and how they are feeling about it. Be sure to be open and honest about your feelings and fears and be willing to listen to your partner's perspective as well. The second step is to research and find a therapist that you both feel comfortable with and that is experienced in sex therapy. Lastly, have an open and honest conversation with your therapist about your concerns. This will help your therapist to understand your individual needs and create a treatment plan that is tailored to you both."
315,"(25M) and my wife (24F) Im Feeling Stuck in My Marriage, how do I move forward from this point?","All the more reason to stop. If you can't plan your futures together without her steamrolling you, its not a healthy relationship. If you're struggling financially, does she plan to work full-time after she finishes her degree? 2 kids in daycare will be expensive; maybe suggest waiting on the second until the first is in school and getting some counseling in the meantime.","The first thing to do is to take a step back and try to understand what is causing the feeling of being stuck. This could be due to a lack of communication, a lack of understanding of each other's needs, or even a lack of trust. Once you have identified the underlying issue, it's important to talk it out with your partner. Try to be open and honest with each other, and be willing to listen to each other's perspective. It's also important to be patient and understanding. It may take some time to work through the issues, but it's worth the effort. If talking things out doesn't seem to be helping, you may want to consider seeing a marriage counselor or attending a couples retreat. These can provide a safe space to talk about your issues and can help you both gain a better understanding of each other."
316,"Our friends (21f & 23m), who are a couple, keep fighting every time we go for a night out. We (20f, 20f & 21f) no longer want to go out with them. How do we tell them?","None of us can tell you how that conversation will go.

I hope, most people can look in the mirror and accept some reality checks.

Just be real with them and whatever happens, happens:

>Hey, this is a hard conversation to have with you.  
>  
>We enjoy your company when we go out together, but sometimes its hard to deal with the drama that happens every night between you and your BF.  
>  
>I don't want to judge your relationship because it's not my place to say. But every time we have gone out together as a group, there has always been drama and to be frank, it gets exhausting to be around.  
>  
>We don't want to exclude you two from hanging out with us, but unless you two can get it under control, maybe its best we don't hang out at bars together.  
>  
>We do go out for dinners and other activities besides the bar. So, we will be sure to extend an invite when those events happen.  
>  
>But as for the bar scene? Our night is always stained by the end of it.  
>  
>I am not trying to create a conflict here, we just want our night outs to be positive all around.  
>  
>Please understand our side as well... Being around a couple that fights regularly is tough and unenjoyable. Just an observation, its clear that the bar scene is a trigger for these fights of yours. And I think for everyone involved, it would be best if we stopped doing it as a group.  
>  
>I am sorry, I think we would prefer to stick to restaurants and other activities besides the bar until you two can stop fighting every night out.","It can be difficult to tell friends that you no longer want to go out with them, but it is important to be honest and direct. Start by having a conversation with them in a private setting. Be clear about why you no longer want to go out with them, such as the fact that they keep fighting. Let them know that you care about them and the friendship, but that you don't feel comfortable going out with them when they are fighting. It might be helpful to offer some suggestions on how they can work on their communication or conflict resolution, so they can enjoy their time together without fighting."
317,What should i 21f do for my sister 35f who just found out she'd have a slim chance of getting pregnant?,"Yeah it's also a shock since there was nothing evident that she might be facing this issue. I don't bring up other people's personal issues anyways but thank you for telling me so i re remember aswell. I did try to rationalize it while validating her feeling to try and calm her down but i do now realise i should just listen she probably knows the info already. Thank you.

I'm really sorry you have a family history of that. Tbh I'm really scared she might get pregnant and miscarry ik I'd be super bad for her mentally ik it's normally horrible but she's already been struggling her entire life and i can't imagine having to go through that. I pray that that doesn't happen tho.","There are a few things you can do to support your sister during this difficult time. First, it is important to simply be there for her and listen to her as she processes her emotions. You can also offer to research potential treatments or fertility options that may be available to her. Additionally, it may be helpful to suggest activities that can help her to relax and take care of herself, such as yoga, meditation, or joining a support group. Finally, you can also encourage her to talk to a therapist or counselor to help her cope with the news."

319,Woman asking a man out for a second date (25F) (24M),"With my (25F) boyfriend (27M), I asked him out on the second date after I thanked him for driving me home on our first. The early stages of our relationship made me finally realize a couple things:

Life is WAY too short to overthink asking a question that will have little to no impact on your life if the answer isn’t yes. 

It doesn’t matter if a woman is forward. Being the aggressor can be sexy as hell to some men. I was VERY much the aggressor with my bf - when I look back on things I did, I get so embarrassed lol. Our 2nd date I asked to hold his hand and then when he dropped me off home I asked if I could give him a kiss on the cheek 🤦🏾‍♀️ no idea where I got that confidence (can I even call it that???) from.

Just rip off the bandaid. You’ll get that second date, but even if you don’t, that’s still okay. I’m a strong believer in if it’s meant to be, it will be. 

Good luck!!!!",Hi there! I had a great time on our first date and I was wondering if you'd like to go out again sometime?

Tips on how to deal with the nostalgia of the good times ?,"You just have to give it time, since there really isn’t. any way to expedite getting over someone. It took me years to get over my ex from over a decade ago. Not saying it’ll take you that long but we all move at our own pace. 

Try getting back to *you*. Your hobbies, the things you did before your relationship. Meet new people, make new experiences and memories during this period.","1. Allow yourself to feel whatever emotions come up. It's natural to feel a range of emotions including sadness, anger, and regret. Acknowledge these feelings and give yourself permission to feel them. 

2. Reach out to family and friends for support. Talking about your emotions can help you work through them and find closure.

3. Find ways to distract yourself. Try engaging in activities that you find enjoyable, such as reading, going for a walk, or spending time with your friends.

4. Make changes for the better. Focus on what you can do to improve your life. This could be anything from taking up a new hobby to creating a plan for your future.

5. Practice self-care. Make sure you're taking care of your physical and mental health. Spend time doing things that make you feel good and remind yourself of your own worth."

It's also important to make sure that everyone is honest with each other and that there is a lot of trust and respect in the relationship."
323,My(20M) Girlfriend(20F) is mad at me because I refused sex,"I don’t know where this idea is spreading, but it’s kinda silly.

Of course we judge people for their past. Our judgments don’t have any meaning outside of our own feelings, but they absolutely still happen. Don’t like that a person you admire is judging your past negatively? Tough cookies, it happened and that’s their opinion to have.

You’re allowed to be uncomfortable. You’re allowed to decline sex when you’re uncomfortable. That doesn’t mean you find her unattractive. It means you’re unsettled by the past she chose to have.

Tough. Fucking. Cookies. Toots.","to her

That's a difficult situation to be in. Respect is essential in any relationship, and it's important to communicate with your partner about what each of you are comfortable with. It's understandable that your girlfriend is upset, but it's important to remember that it is your right to say no to something you don't feel comfortable with. Try to have an open and honest conversation with her about why you said no and explain your boundaries. Hopefully, she will understand and respect your decision."

I'm sorry to hear that. It can be difficult to move on from a relationship, especially if it was a meaningful one. It might be helpful to give your ex some space and time to process their feelings. It may also be helpful to talk to a therapist if either of you are feeling overwhelmed."
325,My (F23) boyfriend (M20) still talking to exes,I’ve already had this talk with him that’s why I’m kinda upset about it. I’ve already told him I don’t like him talking to his exes but he’s gone and done it again.,"It's important to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about this. Ask him why he's still talking to his exes and how he would feel if the situation were reversed. It's also important to be clear about your expectations and boundaries in your relationship. Ultimately, it's up to him to decide if he's comfortable continuing to talk to his exes, but it's important to make sure that both of you are on the same page when it comes to the level of communication you're comfortable with."
326,I (22F) and my boyfriend (24M) in happy relationship but sex is extremely less. What should I do?,"3 times a day doesn't sound sustainable.

If you two are having it once a week, you're considered an active sex life.

What I tell couples with mismatching drives, focus on the quality, not the quantity.

Nail home the sex chemistry and make it so that when you two do have sex, its out of this world.

3, 10 minute half assed sessions a week, or one crazy passionate 2 hour session a week.

The 2 hour session is what people ultimately want, to feel the bedroom fire and genuinely desired by their partner.

If you can make the activity high level, then going once a week becomes less noticeable.  You know its going to happen, you know the fire is thriving, and the sex feels genuine... That kind of satisfaction is typically what people are after.

And you may have to consider that you two are sexually incompatible... You're into a lot more than he is, however, he can explore those things if he gives it a shot. But, again... You can't force things the other person doesn't want.

Now... There is the other side of your relationship to discuss that could be contributing.

* There is a thing as spending too much time together.
* Falling into a dull routine where you're doing the same things over and over.
* LDR, not sure who moved to who. But if he moved here, it could be isolating and kind of depressing if you gave up your previous life in order to start a new one.
* Struggling in other areas such as work or financially can also kill drives.
* Putting too much focus on sex can be counter productive. Sometimes bringing less attention to it can actually encourage the other to open more.

When you're investing into a long term relationship, there is nothing wrong with ensuring that you're getting everything you want out of it. Compromising is great to adapt, but your relationship vision, should closely reflect your reality.","It's important to talk about this with your boyfriend and find out what the underlying issue is. It could be anything from feeling insecure to feeling overwhelmed, and it's important to understand where he's coming from before taking any steps to address the issue. You could try suggesting activities that are more intimate than sex, like cuddling, talking, or watching a movie together. You could also try to make sex more fun by introducing new ideas, such as trying out new positions or experimenting with different types of foreplay. Finally, it's important to make sure that both of you are on the same page and that you both feel comfortable with the amount of sex that you are having."

You can offer to help him break down his goals into smaller, more manageable tasks, or to provide emotional support and encouragement. You can also suggest that he find a mentor or join a support group to help him stay motivated.

It could be due to incompatibility, different life goals, communication issues, or any number of other factors. It's impossible to know the exact cause without more information."
338,My bf (24M)didn't stop when i (22F) said no.. POSSIBLE SA?,"Gurl, that is definitely SA. Regardless if he’s your bf or not, it does NOT give him automatic consent to do what he will with YOUR body. Nuh uh. 

His actions would already leave a nasty taste in my mouth. I suggest you think carefully how you want to proceed with this. Do you want to talk to him about boundaries? ( A clear NO should’ve given him the hint) or you can walk away. 

Best of Luck OP • Be safe","It is never okay for someone to ignore your wishes and continue to do something after you have said no. It is important to have open and honest communication in a relationship, and it is vital that both partners respect each other's wishes and boundaries. If your boyfriend does not respect your wishes, it is important to talk to him about it and make sure he understands why it is unacceptable."
339,I (20f) really like this guy (21m) but he doesn’t want a relationship,Here’s the male perspective: listen to what he says and respect it. If he doesn’t want a relationship then he doesn’t want a relationship.,".

That can be difficult to deal with. It's important to be honest with yourself and evaluate whether you're okay with staying in this situation or if you need to move on. If you do decide to stay, it's important to make sure you're setting boundaries and not expecting more than he is willing to give. If you're not comfortable with this, then it's best to move on and find someone who is willing and able to give you the relationship you want."

It is important to take a step back and try to understand where each other is coming from. Communication is key in any relationship, so try to talk to your boyfriend and listen to his perspective. Find out why he is upset and try to come up with a compromise that works for both of you."
341,What should I do? I am 28F and my partner is 27M.,Thanks for being brutally honest. I think I need more of this!,"There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as every relationship is different. However, some general things that you could do to strengthen your relationship include spending quality time together, communicating openly and honestly with each other, showing appreciation and respect for each other, and making time to have fun. Additionally, depending on the specific needs of your relationship, you may want to consider attending couples counseling or engaging in other activities that can help you and your partner grow and develop together."
342,My(24F) boyfriend(25M) has hurt me once when my dad was sick and now I'm unable to get over it I think?,"You cannot believe him. You know this but you're not used to taking charge of your end of the relationship ""I tried to break it off but he said he'd change"". You see, now, how good his word is. It's not easy to detach but that's what you must do. Doing it in stages with lots of warnings only ups HIS game. Make a plan, find a new way/place to live if necessary, and then pick a day and go. Done. Finished. xo from a granny","It sounds like you are struggling to get over the hurt your boyfriend caused you. It can be hard to let go of painful memories, but it is possible. It is important to remember that your boyfriend is not the same person he was when he hurt you. People can learn from their mistakes and change over time. It is important to give yourself time and space to heal and forgive. Consider talking to a counselor or therapist to help you process your feelings and find a way to move forward."
343,She 18F wants to remain friends with guy 19M who showed romantic interest in her. What is the best way to explain to her that he needs to go?,"She does not seem to understand that he is waiting for the tiniest crack in your relationship or weakness in her resolve. The moment she shows any amount of vulnerability that gives him an in, he will jump for it.","It can be difficult to tell someone that they need to go, but the best way to explain it is to be direct and honest. Let him know that while you appreciate his friendship and interest, you do not feel the same way about him and don't want to lead him on. Remind him that you value your friendship and want to remain friends, but that it is best if he moves on and finds someone who reciprocates his feelings."
344,My husband is all over me and I feel overwhelmed sometimes. 27f 27m,People who can't say no to others usually end up with people who won't take no for an answer.,That's understandable - it can be overwhelming to receive a lot of attention. Have you talked to your husband about how you're feeling? It's important to communicate your needs to each other in a healthy and respectful way. It may be helpful to set boundaries around physical affection that you both feel comfortable with. You can also set aside time to talk about your feelings and work together to find a balance that works for both of you.

The best way to find out if she is aware of her reactions and wants to work on them is to have an honest and open conversation with her. Let her know that you care about her and appreciate her, but that you have noticed that she gets upset about little things and that it has been impacting your day-to-day life. Ask her if she is aware of this and if she would like to work on it together. Explain that you want to help her and that you are willing to listen to her and work with her to find solutions."
346,My [27M] GF [28F] of 9 months lied to me about interactions with an ex. Should this be a dealbreaker?,She emotional cheated and would’ve had sex…. Matter of time,"It really depends on the context of the interactions and the nature of the lie. If it was a minor lie that was easily forgiven, then perhaps it wouldn't be a dealbreaker. However, if the lie was serious and she showed a lack of respect for your feelings or relationship, then it could be a dealbreaker. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide if the lie was serious enough to warrant ending the relationship."

Ultimately, the decision is up to you, as it is your relationship and your life. However, it is important to consider the potential consequences of each option.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/relationship_advice) if you have any questions or concerns.*","It can be difficult to tell if someone is distancing themselves, but it may be helpful to talk with your boyfriend and see if he can explain what is going on. It's possible that he might need some space or time to himself, or that he may be dealing with something else that is causing him to feel distant. Whatever the reason, it's important to talk to him and try to understand what is going on so that you can both work together to address it."
350,My(19M) girlfriend(18F) doesnt exite me anymore and I'm worried about it. What can I do thats best for both of us?,"I'd just end it. Feeling like being around your partner is a chore is usually a big indicator that this isn't going to work long term.

Because if you liked her even as a friend, you'd enjoy hanging out with her. Just sounds like the newness of the relationship was the only thing that was keeping it going.

Just be vague and say that it's not working anymore.","It can be difficult to stay excited about a relationship when it's been going on for a while, but it is possible to reignite the spark. First, it's important to take a step back and assess the relationship. Are there any areas that need improvement? Are there any disagreements that have been left unresolved? If so, it's important to discuss these issues with your partner and try to find a resolution. You should also take time to do things together that you both enjoy. This could be going out for dinner, taking a walk together, or engaging in a hobby that you both enjoy. Finally, make sure to take time to appreciate each other and express your gratitude for each other. This could be through compliments, gifts, or simply spending quality time together."
351,My boyfriend (26M) isn’t nice or caring and I think this incident particularly stuck with me (26F),"This post doesn’t really highlight “mental abuse” but for whatever it’s worth, my (25F) boyfriend (24M) would literally move mountains for me to make sure I wasn’t uncomfortable, let alone in a situation where I could be stung by a wasp - allergic or not. 

If you guys have been together for almost 8 years, I don’t see him doing a complete 180 in personality anytime soon. You also mentioned that it’s been very difficult most of the way, relationships are not supposed to be difficult. If you are genuinely unhappy, separate and explore who you are by yourself for a bit. This sub doesn’t like the “breakup” advice but more people genuinely need to hear it, *especially* young people.","It can be difficult when the person we love isn’t behaving in a way that we would like them to. It is important to remember that you have the right to set boundaries and expectations in your relationship. Talk to your boyfriend and express how you feel. Let him know that you expect him to be kind and caring, and that it is important to you. Listen to what he has to say, and try to come to an understanding together."
352,My (19M) girlfriend (18F) and I are on a break because she feels I don’t love her.,"I agree, I would definitely just ask her what would make her feel special or loved. Or you guys could even do a love language test together, which could give you some ideas as to what to do?","I understand that this is a difficult situation to be in. It's difficult to be in a relationship where one person feels that their partner doesn't love them. I would suggest that you take time to reflect on the situation and think about how you can better show your girlfriend that you do love her. Maybe you can talk to her about how you feel and what you can do to make her feel more secure in your relationship. Additionally, it might be helpful to spend some time apart so that you can both have the space to think through your feelings."
353,40 F went through boyfriend phone 32 M and found he’s been talking to another girl,It sounds to me like you know what you need to do. His excuses for talking to and planning to meet up with another girl are flimsy at best. You don’t “get distracted” and start secretly talking to/arranging to meet up with someone else. Nor does stress about work cause this situation. He’s looking to cheat. He may already be cheating. C’mon you know you’re better than this. Leave this guy.,"If you found out that your boyfriend was talking to another girl, it is important to talk to him about it. Find out why he was talking to her and if it was an innocent conversation or something more. If he is being unfaithful, it is important to address the situation and decide what to do next."
354,Me (20M) and my Latina (20F),"I’ve been in similar situations before, I liked the guy at first, we started dating very casually and then slowly started getting the ick as I got to know him better and decided I didn’t want to pursue things. But cause I was younger (around your age) and dumber I thought it would be kinder to slowly let things fizzle out the way Jennifer is doing, rather than say what the issue is straight-up and risk hurting his self confidence badly. Also, I’m half Latina myself and you calling her “your Latina” is a major ick, maybe that was part of the reason","have been together for about 8 months. We are both very happy and in love with each other. We communicate a lot and try to understand each other's cultures. We celebrate our differences and appreciate them. We both come from different backgrounds and have different views on certain things, but we always try to find common ground. We both enjoy spending time together, whether it's going out, cooking dinner, or just cuddling on the couch. We've been through a lot together and we're still going strong. We're looking forward to what the future holds for us and our relationship."
355,"28F/26F, together 7years. I want to throw my wife a surprise party, but she’s a twin",Here’s an idea. Don’t make it a birthday party. A surprise party from the friends that love you. She’ll never expect that and you won’t have to invite her twin or her family. For her birthday?  A picnic in a beautiful location. Just a thought.,"and her sister has the same birthday.

That's a great idea! To make it a double surprise, you could plan two separate parties for each of them. You could have one party at your home and another at their favorite restaurant or bar. Invite all their close friends and family to both parties and make sure to have plenty of decorations and even personalized gifts for each of them. It's sure to be a surprise they won't forget!"
356,?UPDATE - Cousin (F24) falsely accused me (M31) of sxual assault. Now my family is contacting me after almost 10 years,We wish you the best in life and dont worry man🫡,".

I'm sorry to hear about this difficult situation. It sounds like this has been a traumatic experience for you, and I can understand why you are feeling overwhelmed by your family's attempts to reach out after such a long time.

The most important thing is that you take care of yourself and prioritize your own mental health. It might be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor about your feelings and experiences. It can also be helpful to reach out to trusted friends or family members who can provide a listening ear and support.

In terms of your family, it is ultimately up to you to decide how you want to handle the situation. You may want to consider speaking to a family lawyer or mediator if you feel comfortable discussing the situation with your family. This way, you can ensure that any conversations you have are productive and respectful.

Ultimately, your safety and wellbeing should always come first. You do not have to engage with your family if it puts you in a vulnerable or uncomfortable position. Take the time you need to process your feelings and make decisions that are best for you."
