0,Forging A Return to Productive Conversation: An Open Letter to Reddit,,"Dear Reddit Community,

We are writing to you today to address the recent decline in productive conversations on Reddit. We recognize that Reddit has been a great platform for people to connect and have meaningful conversations for many years. However, we have seen a shift in the recent months, with conversations becoming increasingly hostile and less productive.

We understand that it can be difficult to have meaningful conversations in a large and diverse online community. We believe that Reddit can be a powerful tool for thoughtful debate and discussion if we are willing to put in the effort to make it so.

We are asking for your help in forging a return to productive conversations on Reddit. We believe that this can be done through civility, respect, and consideration of others. We are asking you to be mindful of your words and your actions, and to be willing to listen and engage with different perspectives.

In addition to being civil, we encourage you to be open to uncomfortable conversations. We believe that by engaging in difficult conversations, we can come to a better understanding of one another and can work together to build a better future.

We are also asking you to be mindful of the language you use on Reddit. We believe that by using more inclusive language, we can create a more welcoming and diverse environment for all members of the Reddit community.

We believe that by working together, we can create a Reddit that is respectful, productive, and a place where meaningful conversations can take place. We thank you for your help in making this possible.

Sincerely,

The Reddit Team"

23,Instagram vs. Reality,"There should be a sub for this kind of content, insta vs reality.","Instagram often portrays an idealized version of reality that can be far removed from the experiences of everyday people. Instagram can be used to document moments of beauty, joy, and triumph, but it can also be used to present a false image of reality.

53,The problem with Dunning-Kruger,"Although not directly addressed in this comic, Dunning-Kruger refers specifically to perceived competence in a particular *skill* (e.g. carpentry) rather than (more abstractly) intelligence, an idea that permeates popular media.","effect is that it can lead to overconfidence in individuals who are not actually competent in a particular area. This can lead to poor decision-making, as the individual may believe they are more knowledgeable or capable than they actually are. It can also lead to a lack of self-improvement, as the individual may not be aware of their own deficiencies and therefore not seek out knowledge or resources to improve their skills. Finally, the Dunning-Kruger effect can lead to a lack of trust from others, as they may not recognize the individual's limitations and be wary of their advice or opinions."

As Zuckerberg‚Äôs empire continues to grow, Tom is determined to reclaim his place in the industry and show the world that he was the original innovator behind the social media revolution. He embarks on a journey to reconnect with his old friends and prove to the world that his creation still matters. Along the way, Tom discovers that things have changed since his time at the helm of MySpace, and he must learn to adapt to the new world he‚Äôs found himself in.

The baby crocodile, however, was not scared and stayed put, watching him with curiosity. The fisherman, realizing that the crocodile posed no harm, decided to leave it alone and went about his fishing. 

The next day, the fisherman returned to the same spot and was surprised to see the baby crocodile still there. This time, the crocodile seemed to recognize the fisherman and even swam closer to him. The fisherman was amazed by this and decided to give it some food. He offered the crocodile some of his freshly caught fish and the crocodile happily accepted it.

From that day onwards, the fisherman and the baby crocodile developed a special bond. Whenever the fisherman went fishing, the crocodile would be there, waiting for him. The fisherman even named the crocodile ‚ÄúLucky‚Äù and they would often play together in the water.

Scripts should also include more physical humor and situational comedy, as well as more clever jokes. It's also important to bring back the strong performances of the comedic actors of the time, such as Will Ferrell, Ben Stiller, and Jack Black. Additionally, the stories should be grounded in reality, with relatable characters and situations.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/funny) if you have any questions or concerns.*","The Ig Nobel Prizes are a tongue-in-cheek celebration of the strange and unusual in the world of science. The prizes, awarded annually since 1991, recognize research that ‚Äúfirst makes people laugh, and then makes them think.‚Äù Among the Ig Nobel winners over the years are scientists who studied smart toilets, the effects of licking rocks, and the behavior of chickens in jigsaw puzzles.

The Ig Nobel Prizes are organized by the scientific humor magazine Annals of Improbable Research. The awards ceremony is held each year at Harvard University, and winners receive a cash prize of 10 trillion Zimbabwean dollars. The ceremony is known for its light-heartedness, with a Nobel laureate distributing the awards and a marching band playing during the ceremony.

Some of the more unusual Ig Nobel Prize-winning studies include a 2020 study of the effects of licking rocks, a 2015 study of whether chicken‚Äôs can solve jigsaw puzzles, and a 2001 study of the ‚Äúsmart toilet‚Äù that identifies its user. The smart toilet was created by a team of Japanese scientists and was designed to recognize users by their weight, height, and body shape. Other intriguing Ig Nobel Prize winners include a study of the behavior of cows in a magnetic field, a study of the effects of listening to opera music on mice, and a study of the effects of swearing on pain tolerance.

The Ig Nobel Prizes provide a unique opportunity to celebrate the strange and unusual in science. By recognizing research that is both amusing and thought-provoking, the Ig Nobel Prizes encourage scientists to think outside the box and explore the unexpected."

You can also shop online or at discount stores, which can offer deeper discounts than traditional retailers. Additionally, many schools offer discounts on bulk purchases, so it‚Äôs worth checking with your school‚Äôs office to see if they have any deals.

Another way to save money is to look for generic or off-brand supplies. While you may not be able to find the exact item your child wants, you can often find a comparable product at a lower price. Additionally, many stores offer discounts on supplies purchased in bulk, so it pays to buy in advance.

Finally, don‚Äôt forget to check out thrift stores and yard sales. Many people donate their gently used supplies to these places, and you may be able to find some great deals.

By shopping around and taking advantage of sales, you can save money on school supplies and make sure your children have what they need for the upcoming school year."

224,True history of the New Mexican alien,"I love how I have never seen Leslie Nielsen laugh at anything and yet everything I have seen him do, I have found to be hilarious. What a legend!","The history of the New Mexican alien dates back to the late 19th century. This group of immigrants, mostly from Mexico, began to arrive in the United States in the late 1800s and early 1900s, searching for a better life and greater economic opportunity. As the United States economy grew, so did the number of immigrants from Mexico.

By the 1920s, the Mexican population in New Mexico had grown significantly and many of these immigrants had become permanent residents of the state. As they settled in, they became an integral part of the local economy, providing labor for agricultural, industrial, and service industries.

The New Mexican alien population faced several challenges in the United States. They faced discrimination and racism, particularly in the early years, and were often denied basic civil rights. In addition, they faced language and cultural barriers, as well as economic hardship. Despite these challenges, the New Mexican alien population managed to thrive and integrate into the local community.

Today, the New Mexican alien population is still a vibrant and important part of the state's economy and culture. They are an integral part of the local economy, providing labor for a variety of industries, and are active in the local political and cultural scene. They are a vital part of the state's history and identity, and their contributions are an integral part of what makes New Mexico unique."
