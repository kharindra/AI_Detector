4,Is anyone aware if this is part of an MLM recruitment or anything? We met at a fashion casting call/she does legit modeling work but i'm not sure why she's censoring certain words?,"It's an engagement pod group, so not MLM.
Idea is aspiring ""influencers"" join and then all circle jerk eachother by liking and commenting on each others posts which to an outside observer makes it look like they have much more real fans.

Using 0s instead of os is to avoid automatic detection of these by whatever social media host it is who will shut the groups down as they're borderline fraud if people end up getting sponsorship or brand deals based off fake engagement.","No, there is no indication that this is part of an MLM recruitment. It is possible that the person you met is just trying to protect their privacy by censoring certain words."
5,I had no idea ItWorks was still around,"One of the top ItWorks huns is from my hometown and graduated HS the same year I did. She had crazy success with it while the rest of us were poor college kids. We‚Äôre also in Utah, so a lot of people get married and start having kids really young, which adds to the financial burden.

I swear, at least a third of the women my age in our town joined her downline at some point in the first five or so years after we graduated. Surprise, surprise‚Äîthey all failed except for the woman at the top, and she‚Äôs still shilling away from her multi-million dollar house. The fact that her money was made on the backs of women who made virtually nothing (or even lost what little they had) apparently doesn‚Äôt keep her up at night.",". I thought it was a fad that had died out. ItWorks is actually still going strong. They offer a variety of health and wellness products, including vitamins, supplements, body wraps, skin care, and weight loss products. They also offer business opportunities to those interested in selling their products. ItWorks has been around since 2001 and has grown to become a multi-million dollar company."

A guy had problems with starting his car.  Every Friday he'd go and buy a tub of ice cream as a treat for his family and he noticed that if he bought vanilla ice cream, he'd struggle to start his car. But if he bought chocolate ice cream, his car would start easily. Magical ice cream ?!? 

The answer was far more mundane. Vanilla ice cream was in a fridge in the front of the store. Other flavors were in fridges at the back of the store. So when he bought vanilla ice cream he'd be in and out quickly and his car wouldn't cool down enough to start. Buying chocolate ice cream took longer and his car had enough time to cool down before trying to start it.","1. Not following the company's dress code.

It can be hard to know how to help them without making them feel judged or attacked. The best thing you can do is offer to listen and be supportive. Encourage them to do their own research and look into the company they are involved with. Ask them questions about the company and the product they are selling. Let them know you are there to help them think through the situation and make the best decision for themselves. If they are still committed to the MLM, suggest ways to protect their finances and limit their losses. Finally, make sure they know that you will be there for them no matter what decision they make."

38,"Belief in the ""Law of Attraction"" and magical thinking = MLM victims","Thanks for sharing, this is interesting","The Law of Attraction is a popular belief system that generally states that positive thinking will lead to positive outcomes. It is often associated with magical thinking, where people believe that they can manifest their desires through the power of their thoughts. This type of thinking has been used to target victims of Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) schemes, as it preys on people's hopes and dreams of achieving wealth and success through hard work and positive thinking. MLM schemes have been known to use the Law of Attraction to convince people that they can achieve their financial goals if they just believe in the power of the law and work hard. Unfortunately, this type of thinking often leads to people being taken advantage of and losing money, as the MLM schemes are often nothing more than pyramid schemes that are designed to enrich the company and its owners at the expense of the participants."

Several oils are dangerous to pets, and breathing in any oils is not recommended for young children (under 3, I think is the general recommendation) or anyone with any sort of lung compromise, as it can cause reactions. Overuse with very young children has been linked to reactive airway disorder

Prolonged exposure isn't recommended for anyone","Diffusers can be safe for your health when used properly. However, if they are not maintained properly or used with essential oils that are not meant to be diffused, they can be potentially harmful. It is important to use diffusers with caution, always following the instructions, and to avoid using essential oils that are not meant for diffusing."

Yes, powder mixed in water is one way to make a sports drink, but there is much more to it than that. Sports drinks are typically formulated to contain a mixture of electrolytes (such as sodium, potassium, and magnesium), carbohydrates (such as glucose and fructose), and other nutrients (such as vitamins and minerals). These ingredients help to replenish electrolytes lost during exercise, provide energy to muscles, and help the body to better absorb fluids. In addition, some sports drinks also contain caffeine or other stimulants for an extra energy boost."

The best approach may be to provide evidence-based facts about the product, such as studies that show that it does not provide any health benefits or that it may even be harmful. You can also talk to your dad about potential alternatives that may be beneficial to his health, such as eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly. Finally, it may be helpful to speak to a doctor or other medical professional who can provide more detailed advice on the potential risks and benefits of the supplements."

2. Do your salespeople need to put a lot of money into your company when signing up? Do they need to continue to regularly invest money into your system even if they themselves are not successfully making sales?

3. Are you putting pressure on your salespeople to bring in a certain number of new recruits per week/month/year? Would they potentially be encouraged to present a false image of what working for your company is like in order to bring in more recruits?

4. Is it easy for salespeople to leave your company with few consequences or financial damage if they decide it‚Äôs not for them? Are you willing to refund unsold products back from failed salepeople (if a physical product exists) to help soften the financial blow? Does your company present those who leave as inferior or unworthy?

They act like some of these gurus are fucking celebrities and then hype them up just for there to be zero substance to anything they‚Äôre saying and they have no real significance to the world.","Pathetic MLM hun behavior can include trying to pressure friends and family into joining their MLM business, badgering them with sales pitches, and refusing to take ""no"" for an answer. They may also make false promises about the potential earnings from the MLM business and may try to manipulate people into joining. Other behaviors include using guilt trips to get people to join, spreading misinformation about the MLM business, and attacking other MLM opportunities."
114,How do these course MLMs work,Pretty much... it's such a stupid scam... they tell you they have the secret to building your own unique online business... then they tell you it's to make a carbon copy of their bs and sell it to others,"?

Course MLMs, also known as multi-level marketing (MLM) courses, are online training programs that offer educational courses to students. The courses typically focus on topics related to business, marketing, or personal development, and are taught by experienced professionals. The courses are typically sold through an MLM structure, in which students can earn commissions by recruiting other students to join the program. The commissions are paid out on a tiered structure, so the more students a person recruits, the more money they can earn. Additionally, some course MLMs also offer bonuses or rewards for recruiting additional students."
115,I wish mlm people tried real estate or car sales.,But they'd rather run their own business!,"It is not up to anyone to tell an individual what type of business they should pursue. Everyone has different interests, skills, and passions and should pursue what they are passionate about. That being said, there are many benefits to both real estate and car sales, and those interested in either should certainly look into them."
116,The ‚Äúevent‚Äù was her grandmother dying.,Gran deserved better,"When something like this happens, it's important to take the time to grieve and find ways to honor the memory of the person who has passed away. Depending on the family's beliefs and customs, this could involve a funeral or memorial service, a special gathering or meal, or other meaningful activities. It's also important to provide support to both the person who has experienced the loss and to other family members who may also be grieving."
117,Anyone from Malaysia here?,Not much advice except you should be proud of yourself and you are going in the right direction! Cheers!,"Yes, there are Malaysians here."
118,How do MLM reps choose the strangers they want to recruit?,Are you a living breathing human? Yea they wanna recruit you.,"MLM reps typically choose strangers to recruit based on criteria such as age, education level, income level, and other demographic factors. They may also consider potential recruits‚Äô interests, lifestyle, and other factors that could make them a good fit for their MLM. Additionally, MLM reps may use social media and other online tools to connect with strangers who might be interested in joining their team."

121,Question to ex-Monat huns,"I was in Monat for several years.  I loved the products, but hated the business model.  They have about 10-12 different shampoos and most people only have an issue with ONE single line and that‚Äôs the Intense Repair Line which has just been renamed IR Clinical.  It was my personal fave shampoo but I used it once weekly.  People having issues were/are using it multiple times weekly.  If I had a new customer wanting that, I‚Äôd make them order another shampoo to use in between.  It has red clover extract in it which can irritate the scalp, especially if you have sensitive skin.  Again, use it once weekly you‚Äôll be fine, daily will cause problems. The red clover extract is also in the IR spray/serum and the black 2n1 shampoo and conditioner.  It‚Äôs also the one line that really helps your hair grow.  An experienced rep can help someone learn how to use it but a brand new rep with no product education and advice from upline, will have customers with issues.  It can also be very drying so again good for once a week, not daily.  I hate the MLM business model and no longer involved but my hair did/does look fabulous and extremely healthy.  At the same time, I also learned how to take care of my hair.  Only washing every few days, using a heat protection, using a towel turban, hair oiling, etc which can all be done with any natural hair product brand and doesn‚Äôt need to be Monat.",What was your experience like working for Monat?

They don't care about the people they are talking to, they just want to make a sale. They will say anything to get a sale, even if it means lying to someone. They don't care about the person's feelings or if they are genuinely interested in the product. They just want to make a sale. It's very off-putting and can come off as very pushy and aggressive."

128,"Friend started with Primerica, how do I tell her it‚Äôs an MLM?",Just be blunt but empathetic. Tell her your concerns and warn her to not ‚Äúinvest‚Äù any of her own money into this company. Maybe offer to help her with her resume or something nice like that.,"It might be difficult to tell your friend that Primerica is an MLM, as they may not be open to hearing it. The best way to approach this sensitive topic is to try to provide your friend with factual information about MLMs, such as how they often require members to recruit more people in order to make a profit and how they can be difficult to make money from.

Here's the story of two boss-babes, Abigail and Sarah, who were both top-tier MLM marketers. Both were determined to be the best in the business and were constantly competing against each other.

One day, Abigail and Sarah decided to have a head-to-head showdown to prove who was the better marketer. They both agreed to put their marketing skills to the test by seeing who could sign up the most customers in 24 hours.

The competition was fierce. Abigail and Sarah worked tirelessly for 24 hours, using all of their marketing techniques to get the most sign-ups. By the end of the day, Abigail had managed to sign up 5 more customers than Sarah.

Abigail was declared the winner of the head-to-head showdown, proving once and for all that she was the better MLM marketer."

134,How do they believe this shit?,"""There's no other business model like this in the world."" 

Guess why.","People can believe a lot of things, and sometimes it's hard to understand why. Generally, people believe something if it resonates with them and they can relate to it.

Ultimately, each person is different and they may have their own reasons for believing something."
135,Amway,"One of the many things Amway does is say ‚Äúyou shop from your own personal store by using partners as big as Apple, Walmart, etc..‚Äù but in reality, all reward programs work like that. If you get a credit card, they have partner brands that partner with them to incentivize you to shop Apple versus Samsung. It‚Äôs basic and Amway has not figured out some master anomaly. They also make you read books before actually figuring out what the company/scheme is to make sure you‚Äôre ‚Äúdedicated‚Äù. These books are recycled down and worshipped as absolute truth. Both books you mentioned are great and provide a bunch of knowledge, but they are not absolute gospel as Amway claims. What is happening here is a person who is absolutely sold on the idea of financial freedom and leaving their terrible lives behind to sell you on the same idea. They are being coached to say everything, and I mean everything, by their up line. They come on as poised and knowledgeable but i guarantee they have no idea what they are saying.
