2,Lighthearted Story,,"Once upon a time, there was a young man named John who lived in a small town. He was quite content with his life, but he had one problem - he was always late to work!

One day, John decided to try something different. He went to the local pet store and bought a pet turtle. He named the turtle “Speedy” and took him to work with him every day.

To his surprise, it worked! Every morning, Speedy would crawl around John’s desk, reminding him to get up and go to work. John was always on time after that.

Years passed, and John and Speedy became best friends. They did everything together, and John was always grateful for his little turtle’s help.

The moral of the story is: If you want to get somewhere on time, get yourself a pet turtle!"

8,What Karens are like on a holiday,"The concept of ""not my department"" eludes some people. Their lives are surely very interesting, having perfect knowledge and unlimited access to every aspect of their own workplace, as they surely must. Why else would they assume the rest of use have such knowledge and access in our workplaces?","Karens on a holiday are often very organized and plan their trips well in advance. They usually stay in nice hotels, visit popular attractions, and enjoy trying out local cuisine. They also tend to be quite friendly and enjoy interacting with other travelers.

11,K-Mart manager,"Back when I was in college, I worked retail as an assistant manager for a big box retail store and I carried a lot of keys.  One day while working with the head honcho, the discussion of keys came up and the GM told me, there are three kinds of people, those without keys who don't have much responsibility.

24,Fired from Walmart.,"""I'm wondering if we should have a conversation with YOUR manager about you harassing your customers.""

It just goes to prove that Walmart managers have no clue...they don't even recognize their employees.

How in the hell did he expect to fire you (much less blacklist you) when he doesn't even know who you are? 😳","If you were fired from Walmart, the best way to handle the situation is to accept the decision and move on. If you feel that the firing was unjustified, you can reach out to the company and ask to speak to a manager or human resources representative to discuss the matter. If the issue is not resolved, you can contact the local labor board or an attorney for advice."

Wearing headphones is not a requirement to work at Walmart, and people who work at Walmart may or may not choose to wear headphones while they work."
27,"I don't work here, but...","At least none of those customers was rude and demanding to you, so that's a different kind of post here.",You can contact the store manager or customer service department to ask them about their return policy. They should be able to provide you with the information you need.
28,I was the “Lady” in a Target!,"I worked a couple years collecting data information and was stationed in grocery stores, Wal Mart, Target and other similar places.    I had so many people come up and ask me if I worked for the company I was scanning for information.   I wore blue jeans and a t shirt with a hat and def didn't look like I worked there.   People would get pissed at me for nicely explaining I was not an employee of that store.    I had one guy ask me four times if I worked there as he seemed to think I was bullshitting him.    Also had a customer approach me screaming and yelling and continued after I told him I did not work for the store.   People suck sometimes.","I worked in the Electronics Department and it was my job to greet customers, answer questions, and help them find what they were looking for in the store. I also had to keep the department clean and organized, make sure products were stocked, and help customers check out. I enjoyed helping customers find what they were looking for and providing them with great customer service."

32,My weirdest experience so far,"Sometimes I wonder which is more of a threat, your wildlife or your idiots.","was probably when I was walking home from school one day and I saw a strange old woman sitting in the middle of the street. She was muttering to herself and didn't seem to be aware of the cars that were passing by. It was really strange and I was a bit scared, so I quickly ran away."
33,“I figured since you work in this area you’d know where it is”,“you should know better than to assume” is what i would’ve said,"“No, sorry, I don’t. But I can help you find it if you’d like.”"
34,Moral: Be Careful What You Wear!,"I'd assume it would be somewhat obvious to avoid clothing that mimics the official clothing of whatever store you're in.

Thing is, from the stories I've seen here, it doesn't matter what you're wearing. Looking like a punk? Some random Karen will still think you work in whatever store you're in. Have a labcoat on? Nah, you're an employee whos supposed to fill the shelves. Have an official, very obvious uniform of a different company or even a firemen uniform on? You **definitely** work here, even if you say you don't. Have a suit on? You're a manager, clearly - every Karen is going to scream in glee seeing ya!

There are weird, entitled people like that which are either too stupid or lost touch with reality. They just believe what they want, even if it's blatantly obvious how wrong they actually are.","This moral is a reminder to be mindful of what you choose to wear. Whether it's an outfit for a special event or just a regular day, it's important to dress appropriately and consider how your clothing choices might be perceived by others. It's also important to dress in a way that makes you feel comfortable and confident."

37,“I’m twelve.”,"Laughing at the couple. I’m quite certain that a camouflage shirt looks nothing like a Walmart vest. I also had a I don’t work here experience in my early teens. I had a red outfit on in Staples. lol, at least in my case my outfit was the same colour as the store uniform at that time.",That's great! What grade are you in?
38,Shared misunderstanding,"You're a security guard, aren't you? I ask because we have that same rule. ""Don't be seen off work in your uniform"".","A shared misunderstanding is a misunderstanding between two or more people that is shared between them. It is a situation in which the parties involved have a misunderstanding about the same thing, resulting in a miscommunication or misinterpretation of facts. This can lead to conflict, as each party may have a different opinion about the misunderstanding."
39,Red Vest,"My favorite part was how her immediate reaction to the possibility of being killed was to run to a manager to try to get you fired.  Which is, of course, self-defeating, because then you'd have all sorts of extra free time to kill her.","A red vest is an article of clothing that typically covers the upper body and has buttons or a zip closure down the front. They can be made of a variety of fabrics, such as wool, cotton, and polyester, and can come in a range of styles, including sleeveless and long-sleeved. Red vests are often worn as part of a uniform or as a fashion statement. They can also be used for safety purposes, such as on construction sites, in order to make workers easily visible."
40,Dressed inappropriately for a job I don't have,"""I dress like this just to annoy old, bitchy, jealous prudes, like you, ma'am.""","If you don't have a job, then the dress code is much more flexible. You could wear something casual, like jeans and a t-shirt, or dress up a bit more with a nice pair of slacks and a button-down shirt. Just make sure you look neat and presentable."
41,Positive Post,"Law of the Giants. We may not offer our help, but if asked, we must give it.",Today was a great day! I accomplished a lot and felt so productive. I'm so grateful for the opportunity to work hard and make a difference. It's amazing how far I can come when I set my mind to it.
42,Asked a guy if they were hiring who didn’t work there,"A simple mistake followed by a sorry, no worries all around. Exactly how these mistakes should be.","I'm sorry, but I'm not sure how I can help you with that. Are you looking for job opportunities in this area?"
43,"Sorry, I just work here (Uno reverse)","Damn, whoever hosts that film festival must be making out like bandits by not paying any of their workers for the festival and just relying on volunteer workers.","Sorry, I can't help you."
44,Are you the one that fixes the machines?,"At first i was going to judge you for the way you start your day, but you turned out to be a nice, helpful guy so I feel pretty ashamed for my initial judgement. Sorry.","No, I am not the one that fixes the machines."
45,BF and I Mistaken for Walmart Workers While Discussing Energy Drinks,Sometimes I think that people just give off a “know what they’re doing” aura no matter what they’re wearing from the stories I’ve read here,"This is an embarrassing situation, but it is not uncommon. A lot of people mistake us for Walmart workers when we are discussing energy drinks. It happens especially when we are in the store, and people think that we work there. We usually just smile and politely explain that we are not Walmart employees. We also make sure to emphasize that we are simply discussing energy drinks and not selling them."

50,Resting Employee Face,"Fellas, is it racist to shop?","A resting employee face might look relaxed and calm. The facial expression may be neutral or slightly smiling, with relaxed eyes and a gentle mouth. The employee should look comfortable and at ease."
51,I don't work here in walmart,"Lol this happened to my ex mil. She had a cute fun Christmas vest. It was blue and had a million mini Christmas decorations all over the front (little presents, garlands, trees etc)

We went to Walmart to grab something and some lady comes over and rudely says ""excuse me! Can you help me?!"" 
(I get it, she was probably annoyed at lack of staff and it was packed with people shopping.) But her face when she realized she was getting mad at a semi-elderly sweet lady. Perfect.","I apologize, but I am unable to help you with your inquiry as I do not work at Walmart. You may want to contact Walmart directly for assistance."
52,"No, I cannot go behind the bar and grab you a bottle of Rosé, I’m here to collect plates.",Dude that grabbed you should have got a plate broken on his face,You’ll need to ask the bartender for that.
53,"""If I worked here, I'd care, but I don't, so I don't""",Those are the story where both participants have a funny story to tell. :),"This statement could be interpreted as disrespectful and unprofessional. It implies that the speaker does not take their work or the workplace seriously and does not have a vested interest in the success of the organization. It is important to be respectful and professional in the workplace, regardless of whether or not you are an employee."
54,You are looking for what!?,Reminds of the time I went into the plumbing department and asked the lady there to show me her 3/4 inch nipples.,"I'm sorry, I didn't understand your question. Could you please rephrase it?"
55,"I work here, but not for you.",how dare you not lose your job so they can be smug bastards?,"That's okay. You are not required to work for me. However, depending on where you work, you may be required to follow certain rules and regulations set out by your employer."
56,"""Come on, man! Just tell me where it is.""","Nice logic.  ""Just tell me where it is!  You look like you work here.""  Idiots are everywhere.",The location of the item is not something that I can share.
57,Another wholesome one,Grandpa's ways live on through you.,"Take a nature walk. Going out in nature can be a calming and rejuvenating experience. Taking a walk in a natural setting can also help to reduce stress and anxiety, and can be a great way to spend quality time with friends or family."

59,Another Grocery Store Mixup,"Somehow, she thought that she shopped at the hospital... I know it sounds strange,  but dementia can do weird things to a mind. I have experienced things like this many of a time.","A customer was shopping in a grocery store when they noticed a mix-up. A box of cereal that was supposed to be chocolate-flavored was actually strawberry-flavored. The customer was confused and brought it to the attention of the store manager. 

The store manager apologized to the customer and offered to give them a full refund. They also offered to replace the box of cereal with the correct flavor.

Target employees typically wear uniforms that include a shirt with the Target logo, khaki or navy blue pants, and comfortable shoes."
61,Where’s the Cheese!!!?!,"I've dealt with ""regulars"" from my store who want me to drop my own shopping and help them at a store I have NEVER worked at just because they recognize me.  My own store barely pays me a decent wage, there's no way I'm working for another store for free because some jackass commands it.","The cheese could be in the refrigerator, in a pantry, in a cheese drawer, or in a cheese platter. It could also be on a cheese board or plate."
62,Where is your mayo?,"Why did you bother to tell him? No one that aggressively swears at you deserves any kind of help. I also would have added a word at the end of your fridge comment.
To avoid swearing, I would have added ""moron"" or ""jerk"".

64,Twice in a few weeks in the same place!,"“You should try Specsavers, they could help you”","This is highly unlikely and would depend on the location. If the place is a tourist destination or popular spot, then it could be more likely. However, if the place is a small town or rural area, then it would be highly unlikely for the same person to be in the same place twice in a few weeks."
65,So many stories ...so little time,"So happy to have you aboard! Frankly, people have gotten so unhinged lately, I just don't engage. I would have given her the stink eye and continued on with what I was doing.","There are countless stories that could be told, and many more that will never be told.

However, if you were fired from Walgreens, you should contact your local human resources department to discuss the specifics of your termination. They may be able to provide you with information about your rights and any applicable laws that may be relevant to your situation."
69,The day I got my performance review at a place I never worked at,I'm trying to understand how not being in uniform was one of the last things they checked...,"If you received a performance review for a job you never worked at, it is likely that there has been a mistake and you should contact the employer or HR representative that issued the review. You should explain the situation and ask for clarification on why you were given the review. In some cases, this may be a case of mistaken identity or a clerical error. In other cases, the employer may have confused you with another employee. It is important to clarify the situation in order to ensure that your record is accurate."

72,Can’t tell the difference between navy blue and red,"I have to admit that I sometimes ask other customers if they know where something is. I don't ask until after I've searched for it for several minutes without success and I try to be very polite. 

I've never had anyone get upset with me, or even say ""I don't work here"".","It can be difficult to tell the difference between navy blue and red. Navy blue is a darker shade of blue, while red is a bright and vibrant color. To tell the difference between them, look at the color of the fabric or item in question and compare it to a color wheel. Navy blue will usually appear darker than red, while red will usually appear brighter."

Abigail went around the village and gave out the candy. Everyone was so happy and thanked her for her kindness.

The candy was so delicious that the people of the village started to make it a tradition. Every year, Abigail would bring candy to the village and everyone would share it and enjoy it together.

Keep in mind, I'm wearing a t-shirt and shorts - nowhere close to Best Buy's dress code, or even my own employer's. I told her I didn't work there and pointed at the rapidly-approaching salesperson. She stalked off and dragged the store manager over, saying ""that's him, he refused to help me."" 

The understandably-confused manager told her ""ma'am, he's a customer, he doesn't work here!"" And then tried to get her to notice my very-much-not-dress-code attire.

132,Why Karens Behave The Way They Do,Narcissists believe everyone exists for them.,"Karens are a term used to describe a particular type of person, usually a white woman, who is seen as having a sense of entitlement and a belief that they are superior to others. It has become a popular term used on social media to describe someone who is seen as having a sense of entitlement and a belief that they are better than everyone else.

Karens are often seen as having a tendency to be entitled, demanding, and pushy. They may have a sense of superiority and feel as though they deserve special treatment. They may also be seen as disrespectful to people who don't agree with them or who they feel don't meet their standards.

Karens may also be seen as having a lack of empathy and a tendency to be judgmental. They may also be seen as having a need to be in control and may be quick to anger when they don't get their way.

The reasons why Karens behave the way they do are likely complex and varied. It is likely that many Karens have experienced difficult life circumstances which have made them feel as though they need to be in control in order to feel safe and secure. These experiences may have left them feeling as though they need to be in charge in order to maintain their sense of security. Additionally, Karens may have a strong need for approval and validation from others, which can lead them to act in ways that are seen as entitled or pushy."

However, one day, the old parking lot opened up again. It was a little run-down, but it still had plenty of spaces for cars. People started to come back, and the old lot started to fill up once again.

The old lot was no longer forgotten, and it soon became a popular place to park. People enjoyed the old-fashioned charm of the lot, and it was a great place to meet up with friends.

The old parking lot was now a thriving spot, and it was a great addition to the neighborhood. Everyone was happy to have the parking lot back, and it was a wonderful place to park their cars."

137,The psychology behind IDontWorkHereLady,I lean towards more narcissistic behavior. They're seemingly unaware of uncaring and expect you to help them because first impression they already think of you as beneath them.,"The IDontWorkHereLady phenomenon is a social phenomenon that has been studied by psychologists to understand the psychology behind it. This phenomenon is based on the idea that people may feel a sense of belonging or familiarity when they enter a place of work that they do not actually work at. This feeling of belonging is often accompanied by a sense of comfort and security, even if the person does not actually work there.

Psychologists have studied this phenomenon to understand why people may feel a sense of belonging in a place they do not work at. It has been suggested that this phenomenon is linked to a feeling of safety and security, as people may feel more comfortable in a place they know and recognize. Additionally, it has been suggested that this phenomenon is rooted in a sense of familiarity, as people may feel more comfortable in a place they have been before, even if they do not actually work there.

The IDontWorkHereLady phenomenon is an interesting phenomenon that has been studied by psychologists to better understand the psychology behind it. This phenomenon highlights the importance of feeling a sense of belonging in a place, even if a person does not actually work there. It also highlights the need for people to feel safe and secure in their environment, as this can have an impact on their overall mental health and wellbeing."

The area code for that metro area was only one digit off from my home area. And the paper misprinted it as the local. The rest of the phone number was the same as my parents’. 

For WEEKS we got dozens of calls a day from people looking for work. Even after the paper printed a correction.

I had been warned about the spicy food they served, but I didn't take it seriously. So when lunch came around, I decided to try some of the chili they had made. 

Boy, was I in for a surprise! The chili was so spicy that I had to take a break from eating it every few bites. My mouth was burning, my eyes were watering, and I was sweating buckets. I had to drink several glasses of water just to make it through the meal. 

Needless to say, I learned my lesson that day. I now know that when it comes to chili, it's best to go slow and take it easy. I still enjoy a good bowl of chili every now and then, but I'm much more careful about how much I eat."

He said ""I'm working!""  Okay, but if you don't work for the store, you won't know where (whatever I was looking for) is.","in the process

One way to avoid the “I don’t work here” situation is to be polite and direct in your approach. Instead of simply saying “I don’t work here,” explain the situation in a more helpful way. For example, you could say, “I’m sorry, I’m not familiar with this store, but I can try to help you find what you’re looking for.” By doing this, you’re showing that you’re willing to help, and that you’re not just trying to brush them off.

The reactions you get when you approach the situation this way can vary greatly depending on the person. Some people may be grateful for your help and be appreciative that you’re willing to try to help them. Others may be more suspicious and not believe that you’re not actually an employee. Ultimately, though, it’s better to be polite and direct than to just say “I don’t work here.”"

161,At the dermatologist's,"I've had a similar experience. I've been working as a veterinary receptionist for many years now. The incident that happened to me was so long ago that people still used phone books to look up numbers and addresses.

Me: ""Thank you for calling (Name of Clinic), this is Resident\_Bitch, how may I help you?""  
Caller: ""Yes, how much is your senior discount?""  
Me: ""I'm sorry, sir, we don't offer a senior discount.""  
Caller: ""Yes you do! It says right here in your ad, Senior and military discounts available.""   
Me: ""I'm sorry, sir, but you must be looking at a different ad. We don't offer any discounts.""  
Caller: ""Yes, you do! It says right here, (Name of Different Clinic) Senior and military discounts available.""  
Me: ""Sir, you've called (Name of Clinic) not (Name of Different Clinic). We don't offer discounts here.""  
Caller: ""Then you're their answering service! Transfer my call to them!""  
Me: ""No, Sir. We are not their answering service. We are a completely different veterinary clinic and I cannot transfer your call. If you would like to reach them, you'll need to hang up the phone and dial their number that is listed in their ad.""  
Caller: Grumbles something unintelligible and hangs up. 

The ad for the clinic where I worked at was right next to the ad for the other clinic in the phone book and the guy had called my work's number while looking at the ad for the other one and just refused to admit making a mistake. 

Oh, and I now work at the clinic that advertised the senior and military discounts and our discounts suck.

182,**The Epic Supermarket Showdown: My Battle with a Tenacious Karen**,"Reddit is killing third party applications, and itself.","It was a typical Thursday afternoon at the grocery store. I was there to pick up a few items for dinner that night. As I grabbed a cart and started gathering my items, a woman approached me from behind. She had a very stern look on her face and was clearly not happy.

She started to rant about how she had been in the store for an hour and the store was out of her favorite brand of chips. She was so angry that she was demanding to speak to a manager. I attempted to calm her down and asked her if there was anything else she needed. She ignored me and continued to demand to speak to a manager. 

At this point, I was getting frustrated and asked her to please leave me alone so I could finish my shopping. She refused and kept demanding to speak to a manager. I decided to take matters into my own hands and tried to find a manager myself. After several minutes of searching, I returned empty-handed.

The woman was still there, and she was even more angry than before. She started to yell at me and demand that I find her a manager. I was getting fed up and told her that I had done my best and that she needed to leave me alone. 

That's when the real battle began. She started to call me names and insult me. I was so angry that I started to raise my voice and told her to leave me alone. I could see the other shoppers in the store staring in disbelief. 

Finally, I had enough and told her that I was going to call the police if she didn't leave me alone. This seemed to do the trick and she finally stormed off. I was relieved that the situation was over, but I was also embarrassed that I had let the situation get so out of hand. 

The next day, I went back to the store to try and get my groceries without any issues. Thankfully, I was able to get my items without any further incidents. 

That experience taught me a valuable lesson: never underestimate the power of a tenacious Karen!"

206,"Long Time Lurker, finally have a small story","The nerv you had to be there lunching and didn't help the poor woman like she demanded...

I bet that's how those people  think.

I will say it a thousand thousand times... How in the hell those people think someone who is clearly doing the same that them and wearing nothing like the rest of the staff is wearing, possibly be working for that store/restaurant/etc.

I bet in their heads they think there is a vast conspiracy of retail workers that go under cover to the stores just yo annoy the poor them.","to post

I've been a long time lurker in the forums, reading stories from other members, but I never had anything of my own to post. Until now.

It's not much, but it's a start.

I recently went on a road trip with my friends. We had been planning it for months, and we were all so excited to finally go. We drove for hours and hours, stopping only for bathroom breaks and snacks. We were having a blast, singing along to the radio and telling stories.

At one point, we stopped at a gas station to fill up. While we were there, I noticed a small, black kitten wandering around the parking lot. I had to do something, so I scooped it up and brought it with us.

We named her Midnight and she quickly became the centerpiece of our journey. We'd take turns holding her and talking to her, and she'd make us laugh with her playful antics. We all fell in love with her and we knew we couldn't leave her behind when our trip was over.

So, we decided to take her home with us. We all chipped in to buy her food and supplies, and she's been living with us ever since.

It's been a few months since our road trip, and Midnight has become a beloved member of our family. We all take turns caring for her, and she's a constant source of joy for us.

I'm so glad that I took that chance and adopted her. She's brought us all so much happiness, and I'm grateful for that."
207,I don't work at Winco,"I guess she didn't learn the rule, if you find somebody right away to help you that somebody does not work there!","That's okay! Winco is just one of many employers that are available. There are many other businesses, companies, and organizations that you can apply to for work. You can find a job that is the right fit for you."
208,Asked for help in home bargains when wearing Tesco uniform,"Very kind of you to offer to help. You clearly embody customer service and are good at what you do, rival store colleague clearly doesn’t. Wouldn’t be surprised if the individual had already been asked by the same person for assistance but was given the cold shoulder","If you are wearing a Tesco uniform while shopping in Home Bargains, you can still ask for assistance from the store staff. However, it is important to note that Home Bargains is a separate company and that the staff may not be able to answer any questions you have about Tesco products or policies."
209,I barely work here,"I have to deal with a similar issue. I work in a retail store, but my job falls under facilities and I have no training on any of the retail side of things. I technically don’t even work *for* the store itself, I work for corporate, but we have to wear the same exact uniform as all the retail employees. 

I get stopped constantly, and I’ll usually help if I can, including trying to find an actual retail associate, but the number of people who get annoyed when I can’t help them or ignore when I say that I don’t know the answer is frustrating. It’s even more annoying that the department where I get stopped the most is the one where there is almost never a retail associate around.

My policy is that if the customer is polite, and I’m not in the middle of something time-sensitive, I’ll put in a little extra effort to help, but if they’re rude I’ll look around once and if I can’t find anyone just tell them I can’t help because we have different radio systems (not a lie, but I *can* call security to send someone over).",That's okay. Everyone starts somewhere.
210,Reverse I-don't-work-here,"A cute story. We all had similar ""I don't know what I'm doing in this job story because I got half hazard training.""

211,Woman mistakes me for Tesco worker,"I'm noticing a pattern, and I think my old job is to blame. The wall of marts over the years has gone through many uniform changes, but the one constant is the badge. Employees (at least for the 17 years I worked there) were given the option of either wearing it on the vest/chest (for the bit of time when they decided NO VESTS ONLY VARIOUS SHADES OF BLUE SHIRT) or on a lanyard. When there were vests, you were allowed to wear almost anything you wanted under it (which was awesome when you went on break because instant incognito until the customers got wise to it). The only identifying article that was almost a near constant was the lanyard. In the early days only managers had the lanyards too. So Karen's were able peg the managers right away! That only lasted a year, then they allowed all employees to wear them (presumably because the managers were tired of getting harassed for petty shit). So the lanyard is a dangerous thing. Made to wear around the neck but also a beacon of mistakes. (Edited from bacon)","I'm sorry, but I'm not a Tesco worker. I'm a customer just like you."
212,"Alright, this is irritating.","Why should they have to remove their lanyard?  What I find irritating is that people don't say/ask, ""excuse me, do you work here?""

215,Got ahead of myself today,"I'm a shortie but I'm always polite and ask ""may I please borrow your height for a moment?""",".

That's okay! It's easy to get ahead of yourself when you're excited about something. Just take a step back and remember to take things one step at a time. Make sure to plan ahead and take your time with each task. It's okay to get excited, but don't let it get in the way of your planning and progress."
216,"Big name home goods store, collected a good deed to make up for my many faults.","I think OP was suggesting that the kid is going to be rewarded for a sweet, thoughtful $5 dollar gift!

This is a great way to give back to your community and help those in need. You can also donate your time to a local animal shelter or volunteer at a retirement home. These are all great ways to show that you care and make up for any mistakes you may have made.
217,It happened. Wow,"This is when you go into the nearest store and buy an outrageously loud hat or scarf.  Suddenly, you will be invisible again",".

I was speechless. He had just confessed his feelings to me, and I had no idea how to respond. I just stood there, staring at him, my mind racing as I tried to think of something to say. Finally, I managed to find my voice.

""I—I don't know what to say,"" I stammered.

He smiled sadly and shook his head. ""You don't have to say anything,"" he said softly. ""I just needed you to know how I feel.""

My heart was pounding in my chest, and I felt like I was going to faint. I wanted to tell him that I felt the same way, but I was too scared. I was afraid of what he would think if I admitted my feelings.

So instead, I just smiled and nodded. He smiled back, and then he leaned in and kissed me gently on the lips. It was the most amazing sensation I had ever felt, and I could feel my entire body melt into his. We stayed like that for a few moments, just savoring the moment, before he finally pulled away.

""Goodnight,"" he said softly, and then he turned and walked away.

I watched him go, my heart racing as I realized that I had just experienced my first kiss."

Last time I checked carrying grocery bags doesn't automatically make someone an employee!","If you are mistaken for an employee in a store or other business, it is best to politely explain that you are not an employee.

235,Entitled people yell at highschoolers for volunteering,"Just a wild shot in the dark guess. But the area of space that ""no-one"" can park in, was probably reserved for space for emergency services if they are needed. Fire Trucks, ambulance and police need somewhere with fast access to the scene to park at when they are called.","No, it is not acceptable for entitled people to yell at highschoolers for volunteering. It is important to show respect and appreciation for those who are volunteering their time and energy to help out in the community. Yelling at them is not only disrespectful, but it can also be damaging to their self-confidence and self-esteem."

One day, Julia discovered an old abandoned house in the woods near her village. She was curious to find out more about it, so she decided to explore inside.

As Julia ventured deeper into the house, she noticed a strange door at the end of a long hallway. She opened the door and was surprised to find a beautiful garden full of exotic plants and flowers. 

Julia was delighted by the sight of the garden and decided to explore it further. She soon discovered a small pond with a stone bridge leading to an island in the middle. On the island, she found a small cottage with a warm and inviting atmosphere.

When Julia opened the door of the cottage, she was welcomed by a kind old woman who introduced herself as Idwh. Idwh explained that she had been living in the cottage for many years and that the garden was her special place.

Idwh then invited Julia to stay in the cottage with her. Julia happily accepted and soon the two became close friends. Idwh taught Julia about the plants and flowers in the garden, and Julia helped Idwh with her chores.

Together, the two of them explored the garden, shared stories, and enjoyed the peace and tranquility of the cottage. Julia was filled with a newfound appreciation for the beauty of nature, and Idwh was filled with joy from having a new friend.

Their friendship lasted for many years, and Julia often thought back to the day she discovered the old house in the woods. She was grateful that she had taken the time to explore it, as it had led her to the most wonderful friendship she had ever known."

The officer then informed Joe that the warrant was actually for someone with the same name, but a different address. It turned out that a man with the same name as Joe had committed the burglary and had been using Joe's name and address to avoid detection. 

The officer apologized for the mistake and let Joe go with a warning, but Joe was still shaken from the experience. He contacted the police to try and clear his name and get the warrant removed from his record. After a few months, Joe was finally able to get the warrant removed."

268,An unexpected win-win,"Polite, friendly interaction and both got what they needed. Glad you took the chance!",An unexpected win-win situation could be when two competing companies decide to collaborate on a project that benefits both of them. This could include sharing resources or leveraging each other's strengths to create a product or service that is better than either one could have created on their own.

Literally 2 hours ago a pregnant customer asked me to carry an end table up to the register for her, since pregnant women can't lift heavy items. I happen to be 6 and a half months pregnant myself and told her I'd have a more-able employee come and assist. She couldn't understand why I ""didn't want"" to carry it for her, since it's what they pay me for.

Like, bitch seriously, you're about to buy the fucking table, lift it yourself. They don't pay me to lift furniture, they're afraid I'll file for Workman's Comp or something, lol.","A broken foot can be managed with the right treatment and accommodations. Depending on the severity of the injury, you may be able to stand for short periods of time with the use of crutches, a knee scooter, or other assistive devices. You may also be able to use a standing desk or elevated work station to reduce the amount of weight placed on the injured foot. Your doctor may also recommend wearing a supportive shoe or brace to help reduce the amount of pressure on the foot. Additionally, it may be helpful to take frequent breaks throughout the day to reduce stress on the foot."

To be swayed by others
To let them dictate my life

I should probably stop reading Reddit right now,"Cracking a cold dead heart is no easy feat, and it requires a lot of work and dedication. To start, you need to take the time to understand the reasons why your heart has become cold and dead in the first place. Then, you need to start taking steps to address these issues, whether through changing your mindset, seeking professional help, or engaging in activities that bring you joy.

284,Why do I look like I’m a worker??,I guess some people just have that air about them?,"It is difficult to say why you look like a worker without more information. It could be due to the way you dress, the way you carry yourself, or the way you interact with people. It could also be due to the environment you are in, or the tasks you are performing.

291,I don’t work here but I’ll pretend I do (long but tl;dr at the end),"Decades ago, when dementia was just starting to showing it’s ugly head to my grandpa, he went by himself to run an errand and had to ask a stranger for help because he couldn’t find his way back home. This is a house that he built and had lived there for probably half a century at the time. 

Around Thanksgiving of 2020, my sister and I ran an errand and slowly drove by the gas station that was in the same parking lot. An elderly lady flagged me down and told me she was lost and couldn’t find her way home. She said she’d been driving for hours and had to get gas because it was pretty empty but the station didn’t take checks. She asked if I could pay for it and she’d write me a check. I agreed and told her it wasn’t necessary to pay me back because ‘tis the season and all. 

As she’s filling up, she asks me if I could give her directions to so she could get back home. I attempted to but it was too complicated for her. (We were in a suburb of the main city where she lived.) She asked if maybe I could lead her in my car until she was able to recognize where she’s at and able to find her way home. Thinking of my Grumps and how he found his way home because of a stranger, I decided to pay it forward. Since my sister was with me I told the woman I’d drive her home and my sister will follow. The round trip took about an hour and a half but it was worth it because she made it home safe and sound. 

My dad is now showing the early signs of dementia and I hope if he ever gets lost someone will help him find his way home.","I would start by getting to know the company and its mission. I would familiarize myself with the company’s policies and procedures. I would then get to know the team members and learn their roles and responsibilities. I would familiarize myself with the products or services the company offers and the processes involved in creating them. I would then take the time to understand the company’s customer base and how the company interacts with them. This would include learning how the company markets its products, how customer service is handled, and what customer feedback is used to improve products and services. I would also take the time to learn the company’s financials and how they contribute to the overall business strategy. Once I had a good understanding of the company, I would use my knowledge to identify areas where I could contribute.

293,Jenny Doesn’t Work Here Lady,"This reads the same way as a kindergarten teacher's lesson. 

Jenny was on the playground and noticed that her friend, Sabantha, was calling her other friend, Jarianna, mean names. Jenny felt like Sabantha was being mean but she was scared to ask her to stop and didn't want to involve any teachers because she didn't want Sabantha to get in trouble. Jenny overcame her fear and told Sabantha ""Hey that's not nice, we need to use respectful words!"" Sabantha realized that she was being mean and apologized to Jarianna. 

The three went on to be best friends after that.","Jenny doesn't work here, lady. If you need help, please ask someone else. Thank you!"

295,"I don’t work here, and neither does my friend.",I’m so confused 😕 The situational awareness has gotten so bad that people are expecting non employees to check in the back for them? Big-red-circle store has always been red shirt and khaki bottoms. Maybe they were thinking manager? 🤷🏽‍♀️,We are just here visiting.
296,Because I wear a polo?,"My favorite is when I was wearing sweats and a t shirt looking like the haggard 7 month pregnant lady I am at a Goodwill and was asked if I worked there. And it’s not the first time it’s happened, it’s happened in at least three different places. That time I did look them in the eyes and asked if it looked like I worked there. 😂 I can’t stand the lack of situational awareness.","No, wearing a polo has nothing to do with being successful. Success comes from hard work, dedication, and determination."
297,Some Karen decided to report me to the manager because she thought that I was screaming at a customer but I as well was a customer.,"I can  totally relate.  I  work security myself.   I try to wear a jacket if  I have to go into a store before or after work.  Just to avoid any confusion or misunderstanding . If something happened inside or outside of the store, people would say 'Do something""  People would probably  assume that you work there.    .","I'm sorry to hear that happened. It is unfortunate that Karen was quick to jump to conclusions without getting the full story. However, it's important to remember that everyone is entitled to their opinion, and Karen had the right to report the situation to the manager if she felt it was necessary."

But I guess she can still recognize a kind and effective rescuer!","That's really kind of you! It's always nice to help someone in need.

311,I finally have a story!!,One thing that helps me out if I'm at the gas station I work at on my day off is that my 3yo daughter is usually with me. Lol,"Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She was a curious and adventurous girl who loved to explore the world around her.

One day, Lucy was walking along a path in the woods when she came across an old, abandoned house. She was immediately intrigued and decided to explore it.

Inside, Lucy found an old chest with a strange lock on it. She tried to open it but it wouldn't budge. She searched the house but couldn't find the key.

Just then, she heard a voice from behind her. ""I have the key,"" the voice said. Lucy turned around and saw an old woman standing in the doorway. She asked the woman who she was and what she was doing there.

The old woman smiled and said, ""I'm an old witch and I've been waiting for someone to come and open this chest. Inside is a magical item that will grant you one wish. All you have to do is unlock the chest and make your wish.""

Lucy was excited and quickly unlocked the chest. She wished for her greatest dream to come true and suddenly, a bright light filled the room. When it faded, Lucy found herself in a beautiful garden with a castle in the distance.

Lucy realized that her wish had been granted and she was now living her dream. She thanked the old witch and ran off to explore her new world.

And that is how Lucy came to live happily ever after."

It was fairly regular for customers to demand drinks and sandwiches from other chains, and it got to the point with some upper management insisted if we could figure it out, we should make them anyway.

Didn't always work. We got the weirdest complaints because of it.

It seems no matter how much people told them, some insisted we sold items we did not. ... Some even would call us, a phone number clearly associated with $Store_chain with a robot clearly explaining they were calling $Store_chain and retort when told we didn't carry those items that as we were $Other_chain we *did* carry the items.

I mean, the logo of the chain was even printed on the receipt paper, but they still insisted.

Some people are just *this* stupid, and it BURNS.","type of thing.

Unfortunately, she was quickly shut down by the store manager.

The woman had arrived at the store wearing a suit and carrying a folder of paperwork. She asked to speak to the manager, and the manager asked her what she wanted. The woman explained that she was there to apply for a job.

The manager then informed the woman that she had the wrong place. He explained that Dollar General does not accept applications in store, and that she should apply online. The woman was embarrassed and quickly left the store.

The incident has gone viral on social media, with many people applauding the store manager for politely but firmly shutting down the woman's request. The incident also serves as a reminder to always double-check the address of a place you are visiting, particularly if you are looking for a job."

The branch I managed was in a larger city and I was familiar and comfortable with lots of orders. 

I grabbed the manager who was trying to keep up on making food. I offered my assistance in return for my order for free. He took me up on the offer. After 40 minutes i had all his boards cleared. I then gave him advice on what to do for the rest of the week. When I stopped in a few days later he had taken my advice. He still was struggling but not as bad.

I cut em off and told them they had to pay their check and leave and one of them said...""what if we just beat the shit out of you instead!...""Be my guest but you might wanna look around first!""....there were about 15 bikers lined up at the bar looking at us and 1 said....""just let us know when...."". they decided to pay and leave.","This entitled man had a rude awakening when he decided to mess with a trucker and their friends.

The entitled man was driving in a small town when he saw a group of truckers parked in a lot, and decided to do something stupid. He honked his horn and flipped them off as he drove by. Little did he know, the truckers had seen him and decided to follow him.

When the entitled man realized he was being followed, he tried to speed away, but the truckers were faster. They eventually caught up to him and boxed his car in. When he rolled down his window, the truckers began to berate him and demand an apology. 

The entitled man was so scared that he agreed to apologize and promised to never mess with truckers or their friends again. The truckers finally let him go, and he quickly drove away, never to be seen again.

This experience taught the entitled man a valuable lesson: never mess with truckers or their friends. Not only are truckers tough and strong, but they also have a tight-knit community that is always willing to help and protect each other. The entitled man learned his lesson once and for all, and he has never dared to mess with truckers again."

Background

The 28-year-old Ige is a native of Hawaii and trains out of the MMA Lab in Glendale, Arizona.

He has been competing professionally since 2013 and has had a successful run in the regional scene.

Ige has competed for the likes of Bellator, King of the Cage, and RFA, and he is currently signed to the UFC.

In his UFC debut, Ige defeated Danny Henry via unanimous decision.

He has since gone on to win three of his four fights in the Octagon, with his most recent win coming against Edson Barboza at UFC on ESPN 8.

Fighting Style

Ige is an aggressive striker who loves to keep the pressure on his opponents.

He will often come forward with a combination of punches and kicks and will look to overwhelm his opponents with volume and power.

Ige is also a proficient grappler and is more than capable of taking the fight to the ground if he needs to.

He has a black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and is very good at using his size and strength to his advantage in the grappling exchanges.

Strengths

Ige has a great combination of size and power that makes him a very dangerous striker.

He is also a very good grappler, and his size and strength make it difficult for his opponents to escape his submissions.

He is also a very aggressive fighter and is always looking to take the fight to his opponents and put them on the defensive.

Weaknesses

Ige can be a bit too aggressive at times, and this can lead to him getting into trouble on the feet.

He also has a tendency to fade in the later rounds, which could be a problem against a more experienced opponent.

Also, while he is a very good grappler, his submissions are not always on point, and he can be taken down if his opponents are able to get inside his guard."

So I decided to see if I keep help her find the sewing machine needles while my mom picked out her yarn, just because she was being nice and as someone who occasionally sews I figured I could help.  :)

When people are nice, I'll help them regardless.  If they're being rude, entitled and impatient, nah.  Fuck 'em!",That's great!
379,Lady thinks I work at DQ,You can quit any time you like.  But you can never leave. 🎵,"It's possible that Lady thinks you work at DQ, depending on what you have told her about your job.

One day, Mary decided to go for a walk in the woods. As she was walking, she noticed a strange looking creature in the distance. It had long ears and a bushy tail. Mary thought it was a rabbit, so she started to run towards it. 

But when she got closer, she realized it was not a rabbit at all, but a fox! Mary was so confused, she stopped running and just stood there, not sure what to do. 

Suddenly, the fox started to laugh. It was a loud, deep laugh that echoed through the woods. Mary couldn't help but giggle too, and soon the two of them were laughing together. 

After that, Mary and the fox became good friends. Every day, Mary would go for a walk in the woods and the fox would be there waiting for her. They would laugh and play together until it was time for Mary to go home. 

And that is how the confusion of Mary and the fox began!"

Either way, it's really annoying when you're just trying to go about your own business and people keep getting in your way!","when I was younger, but I learned to handle it better as I got older. First of all, it's important to recognize that it's okay to feel embarrassed or awkward in certain situations. It's natural to feel that way, and it doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you. The best thing to do is to take a deep breath and try to focus on the present moment and your breathing. Remind yourself that the feeling will pass and that you can handle it. If it helps, you can also try to reframe the situation in a more positive light. For example, instead of feeling embarrassed, try to focus on how you can learn from the experience or use it as an opportunity to practice your social skills. Lastly, don't be afraid to talk to someone you trust about how you're feeling. They may be able to help you come up with strategies for managing your emotions in the future."

Our love had been broken, and our hearts were distant.
We had been so sweet, now so sour,
The love we once had had turned into a dark tower."

457,I am not running bar trivia,"No, the guy who sent you to me is the trivia guy. He sent you to me as a joke cause he's an asshole. He will get you whatever you need.","No problem! There are plenty of other activities that you can do instead of running bar trivia. You could organize a game night with friends, host a movie night, or even organize a themed party."
458,Grocery store lady,"It's the ""are you sure?"" line that always gets me!  Yes!  These people are sure that they don't work where they are currently shopping, any type of uniform or not.","Grocery store lady is a colloquial term used to refer to the female employees who work in a grocery store. These employees may have a variety of different roles, such as cashiers, stockers, and baggers. Depending on the store, they may also be responsible for customer service tasks, such as answering questions and helping customers find items."
459,Another sweet IDWHL anecdote,"Yo también hablo español!

What a nice and wholesome story.","In the summer of 2019, the IDWHL hosted a tournament in Canada for the first time. The tournament was a huge success and the players had an amazing time. One of the teams, the Toronto Titans, had a player from the United States who needed a place to stay. The team captain and the rest of the players stepped up and found a place for him to stay for the duration of the tournament. The team even helped him find a job so he could make some money while he was in town. This was a great example of the IDWHL's commitment to its players and its willingness to go the extra mile to make sure everyone feels included."

This happened four more times with different people in that store, and after the last one, the store manager made a joke that maybe he should post a photo of me at the entrance with a notice saying “she doesn’t work here.”

Do this, but also post the name of the idiot that tried to get you fired.

""She doesn't work here, Frank!""","I'm sorry that happened to you. It's not fair or appropriate for someone to take out their frustrations on you. If the customer continues to be disruptive, I would suggest speaking to the store manager or another staff member to ensure that you feel safe and comfortable while shopping."
462,A very sweet IDWHL,If people are polite and you can help them there is no reason not to help them.  I only refuse to help if they are rude and demanding.

Nice job!","A few weeks ago, I was out for a walk with my dog when I came across an elderly couple who were struggling to get up a steep hill. I offered to help and the couple thanked me and told me how much they appreciated my help. The woman then proceeded to tell me a story of how she was walking her dog one day and had the same problem. She said that a young man had seen her struggling and offered to help. She said that she was so touched by his kindness that it made her day. She then said that she and her husband wanted to pay it forward and so when they saw me they decided to offer me their help. I was so moved by their story that I almost started to cry. It was such a beautiful example of how kindness can be contagious and make the world a better place."
465,Coffee???,I always hated it when customers snapped their fingers or did weird sounds like calling a cat or dog over. Annoyed the crap out of me.,"Yes, coffee is a popular drink made from roasted and ground coffee beans. It is usually served hot, but can also be served cold."

Well, I ended up clogging the toilet and water started overflowing the toilet and getting all over the floor.  I had gambled and flushed twice. 

I went to the employee at the register and told her that the toilet in the bathroom was clogged and overflowing. She looked at me and said accusingly, ""Did you do it?"" I hung my head in embarrassment and said, ""Yes...."" The employees eyes got wide and she stammered, ""OMG! I was joking, I didn't think you actually did it. We'll have someone fix it right away."" I slunk out of there and was so embarrassed that I didn't go back for years.","Oh boy. That's not something I was expecting! Before I tackle the job, I think it's important to make sure I have the right tools and safety gear. I would start by finding out what type of toilet it is. Is it a standard toilet, a low-flow toilet, or a composting toilet? Once I know what I'm dealing with, I can safely select the right plunger and protective gear. I'll also need to make sure the area is well-ventilated and that I have access to gloves, eye protection, and a face mask. With all of the right tools in place, I can start plunging the toilet and hopefully get it working again in no time."

481,"IDWH, but I did that day","There is a group of us that used to head over to the 24-hour Perkins next to a bar when they would close. We got there one night at 1:15 a.m. and the staff were completely frazzled, the store was trashed. They had just finished with a huge rush and we're still trying to regain their bearings. There was still a lot of people waiting for food.

Of the group of people I was with a bunch of us worked at a Perkins, some even worked at that one. The ones that worked there jumped on the line and started helping the cooks, while a couple others began bussing tables another wiping them down. I jumped back in the dish area which was just overflowing with dirty dishes and got started. It's amazing how fast you can work after you've been out partying and still holding a good buzz! Lol

We probably worked for about an hour, got everything cleaned up, all the people that were in the restaurant were now finished and gone. We finally sat down and all of us had a comped meal! Totally worth it! Totally fun night.","I can't provide specific advice without knowing more about your situation, but there are some general tips that may be helpful. 

1. Make sure you have a clear goal in mind. Before beginning your work, take a few minutes to think about what you want to accomplish and how you'll measure success. 

2. Prioritize your tasks. Take a few moments to think about which tasks are most important and which ones can be done later. This will help you stay focused and efficient.

3. Break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. This will help you make progress more quickly and reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed.

4. Set aside uninterrupted time for your work. Turn off distractions like your phone and email notifications and focus solely on the task at hand. 

5. Take breaks. Working for long periods of time without a break can lead to fatigue and decreased productivity. Make sure to take regular breaks throughout the day. 

6. Ask for help. If you're feeling stuck or overwhelmed, don't be afraid to reach out to colleagues for help or advice."
482,"I work here, but I don’t work HERE.","Going on autopilot while off the clock is so weird!  When I quit my job in the spring I went back a few times just to shop and had to stop myself from greeting other customers entering the store or going to answer the phone when it rang!

When I have a similar conflict at work, I have learned to say, ""\[Person telling me to do this\], has this been run by \[my boss\]? If not, I need to do that before I help you."" Nine times out of ten, unless I'm doing something pressing, my boss is cool with whatever - as long as he knows about it in advance.","No one works for any one person specifically. Everyone works for their employer, regardless of who that employer is."
484,"I'm working here, but I don't work here","The simple fact he was rude with you until he realized you were there as a client seems like a big red flag in my book.

Restaurants think we are not worth of their time, but many people, at least where I live, work with tourists and deliveries, so we just don't suggest restaurants were they treat us like shit. 😁
Also, we all have internet. I personally know of one restaurant who actually closed because many riders in my city left multiple bad reviews to this place 😅","If you are working at a place but you do not work there, then you are likely a contractor or a freelancer."
485,Accidentally became an employee,Now I wanna know what they had heard...,"If you have accidentally become an employee of a company, the best thing to do is to contact the company's human resources department right away.

489,Can anyone explain this phenomenon?,"People are in general, stupid.","This phenomenon is known as the ""Washburn effect"", and it is a phenomenon that occurs when the surface tension of a liquid is reduced due to the presence of a surfactant. When the surface tension is reduced, the liquid is more easily able to move around, creating increased turbulence in the liquid and allowing particles to move more freely. This increased turbulence can lead to an increase in the rate of sedimentation (the settling of particles) in the liquid. This phenomenon was first described by E.G. Washburn in 1921."

493,Wearing scrubs makes me an employee at a Halloween store,And people generally don't dress up in a costume just to go shop at a Halloween store. Seeing someone in scrubs at a store would make me think that person was an employee in the medical field...out shopping. 🙄,"No, wearing scrubs does not make you an employee at a Halloween store. Scrubs are typically worn by medical professionals, such as nurses and doctors, and are not typically worn by employees of Halloween stores."
494,Used To Work There Don’t Anymore,"My wife worked in the bakery department at our local grocery store for like 10 years, but quit and got a job as an RT working at the hospital when she finished school about 6 years ago.  *To this day* people will stop her while she's grocery shopping, pushing a cart, **wearing scrubs with her badge still clipped onto her shirt**, and ask her to go to the bakery and slice bread for them, or frost a cake, or any of the other million things she used to do almost a decade ago.

What's best, though, is when she apologizes and tells them she doesn't work there anymore, half the time they still want her to go back behind the fucking counter and do what they asked anyway.  Like, the fuck???

Christ are people stupid.",I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to help?
495,Tonic,"When my daughter was little and learning to read, she would try to read labels at the supermarket. She got really excited when she saw the tonic water and exclaimed to my husband ""Look dad, it's toxic water!"" We've called it toxic water ever since.

498,Fired from Walmart - update,"Contact Walmart Corporate and inform them that she is harassing you and banned you because she was embarrassed for harassing a customer.

500,I asked someone who didn't work in the store where the items were!,"As long as you were polite and that person was not troubled by it. Sometimes when I see an other customer in a store holding a certain item that I'd like too. I'd ask> Excuse me, I like the x item you are holding. May I ask where you got it? Etc.","Unfortunately, it's unlikely that someone who doesn't work in the store would be able to help you locate items within the store.

502,I dont care what you think about Eggs,"I worked at a grocery store when I was a teen. I once had a lady ask me why she got a brown potato 🥔 in a bag of white potatoes... I spend extra money on white potatoes and I don't want a white one. They were in fact the same price...I gave her the old im sorry but we do not bag them here. All I can say is perhaps there was a small mix up at the farm... like what the hell do you want from me lady.
  She says no. Not good enough I want to know why this happened... I'm not a vegetable detective so im not sure what to say. Then she flips over the bag, as there are mesh screens on the back to see the potatoes 🥔... see , there and there. And there...lady you are pointing at potatoes with dirt on them... she literally didn't know they came out of the ground. Oh how all the employees laughed after this.","That's fine!

503,Check the Badge,You met the rare quick-witted stranger. You are very lucky.

504,"Tourists Think We Work at the Museum, Because We Thought to Google",I'm surprised that they didn't follow you to get a tour of the city.,"Yes, this is a good idea. Tourists often rely on Google to find information about local attractions, and if you are working at a museum, it is a good idea to make sure that your museum is listed on Google so that it can be easily found by potential visitors. Additionally, you can also make sure to include accurate and up-to-date information about the museum on Google, including hours of operation, prices, and any special events or exhibits that are taking place. Doing this will make it easier for tourists to find and visit your museum."
505,Fun at the local DMV,"Proof, yet again, that people are jerks","No one enjoys a trip to the DMV, but it can be made more enjoyable with a few simple strategies. Here are some ideas: 

1. Bring a friend. Having someone to chat with while you wait can help make the time go by faster and make the experience more enjoyable. 

2. Bring snacks. Having a snack or two on hand while you wait can help keep your energy up and make the experience a bit more enjoyable. 

3. Bring a book or a magazine. Having something to read while you wait can help pass the time and make the experience more bearable. 

4. Bring headphones. Listening to music or an audio book can help you relax while you wait and make the experience more enjoyable.

I paid 5 euros in Gare Du Nord because I didn't have change and was in a similar predicament.,"Immigrating to a country to work in a specific job is not a requirement for immigration.

If you still can't find it, it may be helpful to retrace your steps from the last time you used it."
516,Difference Between Merchandise & Employee,"As someone who's dealt with customers arguing about prices for the stupidest of reasons for a good decade, I have to admit ""Well, the parrot said..."" is by far the STUPIDEST reason to date!","Merchandise is a term used to refer to items that are bought and sold in a business. These items can include physical goods, such as clothing, furniture, and electronics, as well as services, such as consulting and marketing.

Coleslaw can usually be found in the refrigerated section of the supermarket, near the salads."
520,Shoppers Line Up To Ask The Wrong Guy,"You know what really blows my mind about these stories?  

Stores have signs hanging above every single aisle, (granted I can confirm *every* store does this, but all the major ones seem to) and those signs give you an idea of where items are located!  Why can't these grown-ass people read the signs and navigate a store without someone holding their hand?

Bonus points for the people who claim to be a ""loyal customer"" harassing the non-employee and threatening to get them fired, yet they still don't understand the layout of the store despite years of being a pain in the ass at that particular location.","Shoppers line up to ask the wrong guy all the time. Whether it's a question about a product or a service, they'll often turn to someone who may not have the right answer. It's usually harmless, but it can be quite annoying for the person being asked. They may not have the knowledge or experience to give an accurate response. It's a good idea to double-check with someone else before making a purchase or taking advice."
521,"Sorry, I am waiting on the lady to bring me my shoes!","You're probably right.  You get used to employees having a certain look in your home country and then travel somewhere else where it's totally different.

When we went to Hawaii, I didn't approach anyone on the floor in the open air market that didn't at least have a name tag or shirt with the vendors name/logo on it. Some of the employees were dressed so casually compared to what I was used to, that I thought they were customers.",That's understandable. It can be hard to wait for something you really want. Hopefully she'll be here soon with your shoes!

If the person persists, you may want to ask them to speak to the store manager."

All the townspeople were friendly and content with their peaceful, quiet lives.

One day, a new business opened up in town: an ammo store. It was the first of its kind in the area, and the townspeople were intrigued. They had never seen anything like it before.

The store owner was a friendly man who was always willing to help and answer any questions that his customers had. He sold a variety of ammunition for hunting, target shooting, and self-defense. He also stocked a variety of firearms and gun accessories.

The store quickly became popular in the town, and people started coming from all over the area to shop there. The store owner was proud of the success of his business, and he was always thankful for his customers’ continued support.

The townspeople began to refer to the store as “Ammo Store-y”, and it soon became a staple in their community. The store owner was glad to be able to provide the town with a safe and reliable place to purchase their ammunition and firearms.

Years later, the store is still going strong, and it is now a well-known destination for anyone looking for ammunition, firearms, or gun accessories. The store owner is still as friendly as ever, and he is always happy to help his customers in any way he can."

Does she think they charge by the mile?","me

If smelly Karen was expecting you at a specific place, then you were not there as expected. It's possible that you were on the clock, meaning you were working, but not at the place she was expecting you to be."
529,Indian grocery store incident,"Nice to read a good ""I don't work here"" story. Thanks for your kindness","In April 2021, a woman in Atlanta, Georgia was denied service and asked to leave an Indian grocery store because of her race.

531,Irate Walmart customer refuses to use her eyes,">she inquired If I'd assaulted a woman on the weekend

The correct answer should have been “No Ma’am, but I was assaulted by a woman on the weekend and I would like to speak with the police.” If you shoving her laptop back was assault (and it was not), then she committed assault when she shoved it into you.","If an irate Walmart customer refuses to use her eyes, it is likely that she is not able to see or has some kind of vision impairment. The best course of action would be to offer assistance to the customer and try to accommodate her needs as best as possible. If the customer is not able to provide clear instructions on what she needs, it may be necessary to call a supervisor or manager to help the customer."
532,Woman with child tries to shame me for not helping them,"The mother thought it was a great teaching moment to teach her daughter how to courteously ask a question...

Too bad she didn't teach her kid how to identify an actual employee, or how to react when an error is made.","It's understandable that you may feel shamed or judged for not helping someone in need. However, it's important to remember that everyone has different circumstances and not everyone is able to help others.

If you have experienced this, it is important to speak up and report the incident to your supervisor or a manager."
535,Apparently not wearing a shirt or a nametag for a company doesn't matter,"I'm convinced there is a face thing or a smell thing that causes these idgits to approach some of the least approachable looking people.

I am the most antisocial person, am an old fat woman, and have resting bitch face (RBF). But I swear, people come up to me to chat everywhere - at stores, library, beach and not just on the sand but in the water, etc. They will bypass happy looking others to approach me. Either they like RBF or my smell.",. It all depends on the specific company's policies and rules. Some companies may require their employees to wear a shirt and/or nametag while others may not. It is important to check with the company in question to determine their specific policies and rules regarding dress code.

Hi, elevator guy!","Elevator recognition is the process of recognizing and responding to the presence of an elevator. This can be done in a variety of ways, such as through the use of sensors, infrared beams, or by using a combination of traditional and modern technologies.

It is important to remember that the manager may have been trying to resolve a problem or ensure that customers are treated fairly and respectfully."

It's always nice to be able to use your skills to help others. You could offer to help her pick out the best makeup and skincare products for her skin type and color, or even give her a makeover with the items she has already purchased.

One day, while out on her walk, she stumbled upon a small clearing in the woods. In the middle of the clearing was a beautiful lake with a small island in the middle. Lola was mesmerized by the beauty of the lake and decided to swim out to the island.

When she reached the island, she found it was covered in lush green grass and full of wildflowers. She laid down in the grass and enjoyed the peace and tranquility of the place.

Just then, she heard a voice calling her name. She looked up to find a beautiful fairy standing before her. The fairy told Lola that she had been sent by the gods to grant her one wish. Without hesitation, Lola wished for the lake and island to remain untouched and that no one would ever be able to find it.

The fairy granted her wish, and the lake and island remained a secret place known only to Lola. She visited the island often, and it became her most treasured spot in the world.

The End."

554,I still tried to help,"Hey, a NPC that doesn't turn into a Karen banshee is a good day in my book. Gotta be on the lookout!","him

There are many ways to help someone in need. Depending on the situation, you may be able to offer to provide assistance with everyday tasks, such as grocery shopping, running errands, or providing transportation.

557,Need to Vent- Wearing Red in a Blue Store,"Shout random items back at them. They yell, “Toilet paper.” You yell back, “Canned peas.” They yell, “Toothpaste.” You yell back, “Croissants.”","I understand how you feel. It can be really uncomfortable and intimidating to wear a certain color into a store that is associated with a different color. It's totally understandable to feel this way.

Try to remember that you are not wearing the color to make a political statement or to draw any attention to yourself. You just like the color and that's okay!

It's also important to remember that you have the right to wear whatever color you want, regardless of the store's color. No one should be making you feel uncomfortable in any way.

Take a deep breath and remember that you are in control of your own actions and feelings. You are not obligated to stay in the store if you don't want to, and you don't have to respond to any negative comments or stares.

At the end of the day, the color of your clothing is a personal choice, and no one can take that away from you."

If anyone tries to use this tactic on store employees the employee should just take the kid back to the office and call the police to tell them that a parent just abandoned their kid with a total stranger and walked off.","No, working in retail is not the same as babysitting. Retail workers typically help customers find and purchase items, manage the cash register, stock shelves, and provide customer service.

576,Black Shirt? You must work here,"I don’t see a big deal asking a taller person if they can get something for you. Last week I was at the store trying to get a cheesecake assortment all the way at the back. I’m short but the real problem was that I’d fallen the week before and had badly bruised my ribs. After several ineffective reaches, I looked around and asked a woman walking by for help. I asked nicely and explained about my ribs. We had a brief moment together and it was done. Not a big deal at all. If it had been meeting spotting the (taller) person in a black shirt, for sure I’d have asked if he could please help me.

A jacket or sweater may also be required depending on the climate or workplace."
578,Got followed around by a customer and some cops while shopping,"Someone probably called the cops because you come in often in a grey hoodie, talk to no one, and leave without spending a lot. They figure you're stealing but can't figure out how so they get the cops in on it. Lady was probably a cop too. This happened to me. I worked at a wally world but shopped at another red circle store nearby. I would only get whatever my mom asked me to pick up and go home. I almost got cuffed one day after the cops finally confronted me. Apparently just buying 1 thing is suspicious and covering up my clothes/not having a purse is too. I was 18 and didn't want anyone to know I worked at the worst store in town!","If you are being followed around by a customer and some cops while shopping, it is important to remain calm and alert. If you are feeling threatened, you should consider leaving the store and reporting the incident to the store manager or to the police.

The amount of people who will see me kneeling and digging at this drawer and somehow assume that I am actually a cashier at that register blows my mind sometimes. 

For any target shoppers, here’s a quick reference sheet: lights on, lane is open. Lights off, lane is closed.","It is important to stay calm and be patient in this situation. It is likely that the person is confused and may need help understanding the situation. If possible, try to explain the situation to them and help them find an alternate route or solution. If the person is still confused, it may be best to contact a store manager or staff member to help resolve the issue."
580,Why I hate shopping,Sucks to suck,"I hate shopping because it can be stressful, expensive, and time-consuming. Shopping can be a chore, especially if you are trying to find the perfect item or outfit. It often involves endless searching and trying on clothes, which can be exhausting. Shopping can also be expensive, especially if you are looking for quality items. And it can be time-consuming, as you have to take the time to go from store to store or scroll through websites to find what you are looking for."

Eh, maybe she did but is the type of person who's too stubborn to admit they're wrong and would rather keep their delusion going no matter how off-the-wall it becomes. Honestly, I just wish those people knew how much worse THAT is than just being wrong every once in a while like every single human ever.","It is not your place to make decisions about someone else's appearance. If you feel that someone else could benefit from a haircut, it is best to suggest it to them and let them make the decision for themselves."

589,"""Ma'am, I'm a foreigner, I can't work here""","I live in Japan and it’s fairly common for there to be an English sign at the cashier saying simply “NO EXCHANGE”.

Japan isn’t really known for having lenient product return policies so I assumed that’s what it was about and ignored it until once I was buying something that was expensive and fragile and boxed so I asked (in Japanese) if there is any problem with the product can I really not exchange it?  

They said of course you can. So I pointed to the sign and said I was worried this meant I couldn’t. 

They said no that isn’t about product exchanges, it means no money exchange. Because apparently there is a problem with specifically Americans trying to buy things using dollars.

Blew my mind someone would even think that were possible in a foreign country.","Unfortunately, I cannot help you as I am not familiar with the employment laws in your country.

590,Strange Encounter,"I’m going to be honest. People come up to me ALL THE TIME and ask me stuff. In stores. Office building. All types of places. And so many even say, ‘I know you don’t work here. You just look like you know.’

Funny thing is. Lots of time I actually DO know. 

Maybe you just looked smart.","I was walking down the street one day when I suddenly felt a chill run down my spine. I turned around to see what had caused it and saw a strange figure standing a few feet away. It was a tall, thin creature with pale skin and long, white hair. Its eyes were a deep, dark black and it was wearing a long, black cloak. I could feel its gaze upon me and I was filled with a feeling of unease. I took a few steps back and the figure moved closer. I was about to turn and run when it spoke in a soft voice.

""Don't be afraid,"" it said. ""I mean you no harm.""

I was still scared, but I was also intrigued by this strange creature. I asked it who it was and it replied that it was a guardian of sorts, sent to protect me. I asked it what it meant by that and it said that it was here to make sure I stayed safe and that I followed a certain path. It said that it would be watching me and that I should be careful.

I thanked the creature for its warning and it nodded before disappearing into the shadows. I never saw it again, but I still remember that strange encounter and the feeling of unease it left me with."
591,Every nurse does not work at every medical office.,"""But if you’re able to stand at a window and shout at staff members, you’re probably not a critical patient.""

I grew up in a family medics - one E.M.S. and one E.M.T., 2 firefighters and 4 nurses - and I've heard this my whole life!  The people who have the energy to complain aren't nearly as sick as they want everyone to think they are, whereas the people who are quietly curled up in their misery are too weak, too sick or in too much pain to put up a fuss and are seen as a priority.

Not to mention BASIC MANNERS go a very long way in a much smoother and easier medical appointment or procedure.  You *really* don't want to piss off the people who are in charge of needles and catheters...","Each medical office is staffed with a variety of medical professionals, including but not limited to, nurses, doctors, receptionists, and medical assistants. Depending on the size and type of practice, a medical office may have a few or many nurses on staff."
