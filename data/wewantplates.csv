209,We DON'T want plates - a rant,"Right, because washing a shovel is easier.","I don't understand why some people think it's necessary to use plates for every meal. It's a huge waste of resources and time. Plates are often made of plastic or some other non-biodegradable material, so they just add to the world's mounting waste problem. Plus, they're often too large for the amount of food that's served, so it's just wasteful.

Not to mention the amount of time it takes to clean up after a meal. You have to wash all the dishes, scrub them, and then put them away. It's a huge hassle, especially if you're in a rush.

In my opinion, it's much easier and more efficient to just use bowls or other reusable containers. You can just throw them in the dishwasher when you're done, and they're ready to go again. It's much easier and more efficient than having to clean up after a meal with plates.

So, if you don't want to waste resources and time, then don't bother with plates. Stick with bowls and other reusable containers instead."

I don't care how clean they got that table, the thought of eating directly off it is just repugnant.","There are a number of reasons why negotiations may take place over a table. By having a physical table as a barrier between the two parties, it can create a sense of formality and professionalism to the proceedings. It also allows both parties to have the same amount of space and to have documents and other materials easily accessible. The table can also provide a visual cue to both parties that they are in a business setting and not a social one."

Gordon Ramsay might like to have a word!","Ice cream can be served on a cutting board, but it is not a recommended practice.
