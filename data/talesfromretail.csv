0,Monthly TFR Express Lane - Post your short retail anecdotes and experiences here!,"Dear customers,

When you go to the grocery store, please pay for your food before you eat it. If this is not feasible (say, due to a medical condition), please hang on to the packaging so the cashier can ring it up correctly.","1. I recently had a customer come into the store and ask for a product we didn't carry. I offered to order it online for the customer, who ended up being so grateful they gave me a generous tip!

2. I had a customer come in looking for an item that was out of stock. I offered to check with the other stores in the area and was able to get the item for them the same day. They were so happy and thanked me profusely. 

3. I had a customer come in looking for a very specific product. After some searching, I was able to find the item for them and they were so surprised and grateful that I had gone the extra mile."

2,“You just lost a great customer.” Ok then.,"I wonder what they expect to happen when they say things like ""You just lost a customer.""  Do they think we're going to beg to be allowed to do whatever they want if they promise not to leave?  Because that's pretty much not going to happen.  Most of the time, we have little celebrations that someone really annoying is never coming back.","Bye.

I'm sorry to hear that. We value all our customers and would like to make it right. Can you please let us know what happened so we can help?"
3,Customer thinks we should open for his convenience and not just during our hours of operation.,"FFs who are these nuts? What kind of pants emergency did he have that he needed then that badly??

Reminds me of the guy who pried our doors open in the middle of the night, and when we told him that we weren’t open yet, he asked why the doors weren’t locked. We told him it was so people could get out in case of an emergency.  he asked what people were there. 

like sir, I am a people.","Unfortunately, we cannot open for customers outside of our established hours. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. However, we do appreciate your feedback and will strive to provide the best customer service possible during our hours of operation."
4,Customer threw her shopping at me.,"""I'm never shopping here again!"" - typical Karen

""...Is that a promise?"" - fed up worker",I'm sorry to hear that. It's never acceptable to throw objects at someone. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help resolve the situation.

6,customer called cops over $4 cookie,I wish the police would have come to take her in for making illegitimate 911 calls.,"If this actually happened, it would be considered an extreme overreaction. Depending on the context of the situation, the customer may have been upset with the quality of the cookie or the customer service they received. In either case, the customer should not have called the police over a $4 cookie."
7,Who even pays attention to the music in a retail store?,Just straight up say you checked and you dont have it. Some people never leave their house,"Many people pay attention to the music in a retail store. Music is known to influence customers’ moods, and the right music can create a pleasant atmosphere that draws customers in and encourages them to stay longer. Music can also create a unique atmosphere that sets a store apart from its competitors."
8,So…go the opposite direction?,This is what happens when I tell people ' To open the bathroom door you need to push the handle down to the right.' They pull the door handle up to the left and complain that I gave them the wrong instructions every time. My Theory is they detach their head and toss it into the trash so they can go deaf and blind -with a motor low IQ mouth- before stepping foot into a retail place. LOL,"Yes, by going in the opposite direction, you can often find a new perspective on a problem or situation. This can help you come up with new ideas or solutions you may not have thought of before."
9,Welp… I ruined another wedding /s,"I work for a drugstore that does a lot of photo products, both in the store and sent out. 

I get so many complaints about how I personally messed up something (usually wedding or shower invites) because the person sending it couldn’t be bothered to make sure they checked the cropping on their photos. 

Sure, totes my fault. 🤷🏻‍♀️","I'm sorry to hear that. It can be difficult to navigate social situations, especially when emotions are high. What happened? Do you think there's anything you can do to repair the relationship? It may be worth talking to the couple and offering an honest apology."
10,Thin blue line,I'll bet he was pissed.,The thin blue line is a phrase used to refer to the police force and their role of maintaining order and protecting the public.

He was yelling and cursing at us for being in the wrong lane and not having the right kind of fuel. We apologized and quickly moved to the correct lane. He finally calmed down and let us fill up our tank.
14,I'm not made of money: The sequel,Someone trying to receive $7500 at a random grocery store would be more than enough to raise alarm bells in my head. That whole thing sounds super sus.,"I'm not made of money: The sequel is a sequel to the original film I'm Not Made of Money. It follows the same premise as the first film, which is about a young man who is trying to make ends meet while dealing with the struggles of life. The sequel follows the main character as he continues to navigate his way through life, while dealing with the challenges of money and relationships. The film also introduces new characters who help him on his journey."
15,Some people expect magic..,Crying over a bottle tells me that he’s a pitiful human,"Some people expect magic to occur in their lives, believing that something extraordinary will happen that will make their lives better. However, this is not the case, and it is important to remember that magic is not real and that any changes in life must be achieved through hard work and dedication."
16,"This customer seriously needed to ""chill""!","She obviously had no chill, that's why she needed ice in the first place.","It can be difficult to remain patient and understanding when dealing with a difficult customer, but it is important to remain professional and courteous. Remind the customer of the policies and procedures that have been established to ensure the best service, and if necessary, suggest that they take a break to cool down before continuing the conversation."
17,"Father came into a sporting goods store and talked for his son the entire time, only allowing his son to get the most ""expensive"" equipment. His son ended up coming back with his older brother to apologize for his father and talk to me about baseball.",What an outrageous flex; a fool and his money are easily parted,He was so passionate and I was really impressed that he had the courage to come back and talk to me after his father's behavior. It was really nice to see.
18,"“Here let me help. No? I’m going to, anyway”","> I could lose my job if he gets hurt doing my work.

I've found that actually saying this out loud stops most would-be ""helpers"" in their tracks.","In this situation, it is important to remain firm and polite in your refusal. You can say something like ""No thank you, I can manage. I appreciate the offer, though."""
19,Just follow the directions I gave you,"""Go this way and it's the first aisle on the right.""

Watch customer walk past several aisles towards the back of the store.

Oh well","To follow the directions, read each step carefully and take action on each instruction. Depending on the task, this could involve gathering materials, completing a task, or making a note. It is important to complete each step in order and double-check your work to make sure it is accurate."
20,"No, a 4-pack is not cheaper than a 2-pack","
Why has your manager not banned this guy from the store for verbally abusing the staff",". Generally, buying in bulk will be cheaper per unit, so a 4-pack will usually cost more than a 2-pack."
21,Customer perpetually confused about store credit.,You can *explain* it to them. You can not *understand* it for them.,"If a customer is perpetually confused about store credit, it is important to provide them with clear and concise information about how the store credit works. This can be done by providing them with a written description of store credit policies, as well as a visual demonstration of how store credit works. Additionally, customer service representatives should be trained to answer any questions customers may have regarding store credit. Finally, it is important to provide customers with clear and consistent messaging about store credit policies."
22,"Can I pay with this?- no, that's not money","Poor lady, i hope she has someone watching out for her!",
23,Dumbasses in the self-checkout,That third story I had happen at my work where a lady simply walked up the self checkout with an “Out of Order” sign and flipped it or took it off,"Some people are not familiar with technology and can have difficulty navigating through the self-checkout. This can lead to frustration and confusion, resulting in some customers making mistakes or taking longer than usual to complete their purchase."
24,Mad about driving home,"The customers are never right, and they are mad about it.","I'm mad about driving home
When the sun is setting low
The sky's a beautiful hue
And the air is thick with dew

I'm mad about driving home
When the night has just begun
The stars are shining bright
And the moon's a silver light

I'm mad about driving home
When the roads are winding and slow
The music's playing loud
And the windows are rolled down

I'm mad about driving home
When the night is still and calm
The birds are singing sweet
And I can smell the summer heat

I'm mad about driving home
When I'm feeling all alone
The trees are gently swaying
And the breeze is softly playing"
25,Customers hiding items for later?,Just another oblivious person who has no idea other people and customers exist.,"Yes, customers can hide items for later in some online stores. Most online stores provide a ""wish list"" feature that allows customers to save items for later. This feature is especially useful for customers who are browsing for gifts or items that they may not be ready to purchase yet."
26,She already yelled at me,"Some people think being scolded - even indirectly, like you did in regards to your coworker - is the same as being yelled at, as in with higher volume voice, aggressively. These people are idiots but they exist.","It can be difficult to know how to respond when someone yells at you, but it is important to remain calm and try to keep the situation from escalating. If the person who yelled at you is someone you know, like a friend or family member, you could try talking to them calmly about why they were upset. If it was a stranger or someone you don't know well, you could try to remove yourself from the situation and take a few moments to calm down before addressing it."
27,We swear we checked the right spot,"Sometimes I wish people would just admit that they lost interest in finding the thing and want you to bring it to them.

Just say ""I want the thing, but I don't want to go get it myself.  I want to have someone put it in my hands while I stand here doing nothing.""",We can understand if you are frustrated with us. We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused. We will double check the spot and make sure we are looking in the right place. Let us know if there is anything else we can do to help.
28,"“If I could read, I’d be dangerous”","My great grandma used to say this. 

Example:
Gram: We're out of catfood.

Me: No we aren't. It's right there on the counter.

Gram: No that's the cereal. Where does that box say cat food?!

Picks up the box and reads it. Sees that it is in fact catfood, and says it right on the box

Gram: Wow. If I could read I'd be dangerous. I swear, I'm not stupid.","This phrase is often used to describe someone who is very knowledgeable in a particular area, but lacks the ability to read and write. It implies that if they could read, they would be even more powerful in their knowledge."
29,Staring Contest,TIL there is such a thing as smoked neck bones.,"A staring contest is a game in which two people take turns trying to make the other person look away first. The game usually involves locking eyes with the opponent, without blinking or looking away. The first person to look away is the loser."
30,Special service,What's your address so I can send you stuff to wrap? Don't worry. I'll pay for it.,"The special service was a bus service operated by Northumbria Motor Services in the Newcastle upon Tyne area from the 1930s to the 1950s.

In the 1930s, Northumbria Motor Services operated the special service to a number of destinations in the Newcastle area. These included the Newcastle Central Station, the University of Newcastle, and the Royal Victoria Infirmary. The service was operated using a fleet of single-deck buses.

The service was discontinued in the 1950s due to competition from other bus operators."
31,Woman did not understand 2+1=3,Wait what? Let me git my calcalater.,"No, woman does not understand 2+1=3. Humans understand mathematics, but woman is not a human, so she cannot understand mathematical equations."
32,Woman claims to have driven 50 minutes to come to my store to sell a Wii.,"Man, she needed that $50 to pay for drugs. How could you do that to her? /s","I would thank the customer for taking the time to come to my store and ask them to provide proof of ownership. I would also ask to see the Wii and any accessories that come with it to ensure that it is in good working condition. If everything checks out, I would offer the customer a fair price for the Wii."
33,almost started crying,"A comforting thought: Imagine the misery of that customer's life, and the misery she inflicts on those she lives with.","It can be difficult to start crying, especially if you are feeling overwhelmed or emotional. It is important to take a moment to pause and allow yourself to feel the emotions that are coming up. You can take some deep breaths, close your eyes, and focus on the feelings in your body. You can also try talking to someone who can provide support or comfort. If you still feel the need to cry, it is okay to let it out."
34,Price Matching,"The customer was stealing, or at the very least, abusing the system. Your manglement doesn’t have the stones to stand up to customers stealing.

None of this should concern you. Call the manager over, have them approve the changes and go on.  When they bring it up with you, please remind them of the store policies and ask for clarification in writing.",The Home Depot does not currently offer price matching.
35,Lady Thought I did something with her phone,"On a separate note, this bothers me: ""So an Old Lady comes in and asks if we found a phone, I show it to her and she says it’s hers and I give it to her.""

Why do you do that? Anybody could say, ""Yeah, that's my phone,"" when it isn't. You should ask for some identifying info about the phone, or ask them to unlock it in front of you.","That would depend on what you did. If you used her phone without her permission, it could be considered stealing or unauthorized use of property. If you damaged her phone, you could be liable for the cost of repairs or a replacement phone."
36,Person dumps item they claim was precious to them and it hurts them because they needed money.,It's people like this that make me question every sad story which is just a shame.,"It can be incredibly difficult and painful to part with something that is precious to us, especially if it is a means of providing financial security. It is important to remember that the item can be replaced, and that money can be earned in other ways. It may be helpful to talk to a friend or family member about the situation and brainstorm other options for making money. Seeking out professional help, such as a financial advisor or therapist, can also be beneficial."
37,I don't know the price of the item I just priced,"One shop I go to if the tag has been removed from the item, the workers take it “in the back to be retagged” and the customer is not allowed to buy it at all. The item doesn’t go back out to the sales floor for at least a day. This policy has greatly reduced the frequency of tags falling off of merchandise.","Unfortunately, without knowing what item you just priced, it is impossible to answer the question."
38,Customer bought me a pillow!,"I work at a grocery store and there’s a semi regular customer who is a super sweet older woman who I think is possibly from somewhere in Eastern Europe, and every time she checks out she insists on giving the cashier and the bagger something. 

Sometimes it’s fruits from the bag she just bought, or she’ll buy candy bars specifically to give us. 

Sometimes she’ll even give something to the people working the other registers that day, too, if she knows us. 
Most recently I was working self checkout and she came through and was asking me my recommendation on candy, just so she could give me the one I liked most. 

She’s so unbelievably sweet.",That's so kind of them! Thank you for sharing. It's always nice when someone goes out of their way to do something special for you.
39,Daily dose of retail lol pt2,Why do people keep abusing the people who just want to help them?? Don't they realize that they would get far better help if they were polite and nice for once in their life?,"Retail can be a lot of fun! Here are some more retail-related jokes:

Q: What did the cashier say to the customer who asked for a discount?
A: ""I'm sorry, I can't give you a discount, but I can give you a receipt!""

Q: How did the store manager react when a customer asked for a refund?
A: He said, ""No refunds, only exchanges!"""
40,"First week, and was told I was incompetent by a customer lol.","Why does this woman come into a store and expect things to be free? 
This gratis-mentality is killing me","That's not a great way to start out, but don't let it get you down. It's important to remember that customers can sometimes be challenging and that you do your best to handle the situation with professionalism and respect. Remember that it's not a personal attack, and focus on finding a way to resolve the issue."
41,Customers don't read signs,Reminds me of the meme that says “this sign won’t stop me because I can’t read.”,"Customers may not always read signs, but it is important to make sure that signs are placed in visible locations that will draw their attention. Signs should be written in an easy to understand language and should include any necessary instructions or information. Additionally, signs should be updated regularly to ensure that customers have the most up-to-date information."
42,You’ll Go to the Return Desk if You Want your Money Back,"I suspect that it wasn't about the money so much as A) getting his own way, B) making you do what he said so he could feel powerful, or C) both at once.

Since he never went to the returns desk, he probably just wanted you to say ""Yes sir"" and do what you were told like a good servant.","If you are unsatisfied with an item that you purchased and would like to return it for a refund, you should go to the return desk. Depending on the store's policy, you may need to bring a receipt or other proof of purchase. The return desk staff will be able to provide you with instructions on how to process your return and get your money back."
43,Angry at me for something I don't control (most of the time),"So first, customer was definitely wrong coming at you with the rude and angry manner.  But a lot of people aren't great at managing their emotions and I can understand why he was frustrated.

You're right, everything is getting more expensive, which is why a lot of people end up going to thrift stores - they can't afford to shop at regular stores.  However, a lot of thrift stores lately have raised their prices to the point that it's literally cheaper to buy brand new stuff at your average mega-store, than buy used stuff from thrift stores.

As it comes to the pricing situation, I find it a bit weird that EVERYONE working there touches the pricing, I don't think that is very typical.  Did the owner give you some real specific training on how he expects prices to be set? Otherwise it gets left very open to interpretation by individual employees and prices vs quality could differ drastically.

It's cool that your store supports an animal shelter.  Really I think most thrift stores are run for some sort of charitable cause.  Customers get better deals and the money goes to something useful instead of some corporate bigwig's pockets.  But generally due to this charity, most thrift stores don't get re-models, because that is typically a giant waste of money just to make things look slightly cooler.  So if prices are going up to support paying a re-model, that doesn't really trend towards the charitable aspect.  Now if the place as a dump and falling apart and it HAD to be done? Ok I guess.

TLDR; customers are going to complain no matter what, but his complaint is at least halfway valid","It's understandable to feel frustrated when you don't have control over a situation, but it's important to remember that it's not your fault. If you think there's a way you can help to resolve the issue, then try to do so, but if not, it's best to try to stay calm and accept that it's out of your hands."
44,Teens Stealing (again),"Not your responsibility, not your problem, not your money.","Teens stealing can be a very serious problem. It is important to understand why teens may be stealing and to take steps to prevent it.

First, it is important to understand why teens steal. There are many different reasons, including peer pressure, poverty, or simply wanting something they can’t afford. It is also important to note that teens may not realize the consequences of stealing or may not think they will get caught.

Once the underlying cause of the stealing has been identified, it is important to take steps to prevent it. Parents and guardians can set clear expectations and consequences for stealing, as well as encouraging positive behaviors. Parents and guardians should also monitor their teen’s behavior and activities, and talk to them about the importance of honesty and integrity. Additionally, parents and guardians should make sure their teen has access to the resources they need, such as money for necessary items or help with schoolwork.

Finally, it is important to involve other adults in the teen’s life. This could include teachers, coaches, or mentors. These adults can help provide guidance and support for the teen.

By understanding why teens may be stealing and taking steps to prevent it, parents and guardians can help keep their teen from engaging in this kind of behavior."
45,I peaked early. I had my best customer when I was 16.,"Mmmm…werther’s originals. Damn good candy, especially if you have a cold!",That's amazing! It's definitely impressive to have your best customer at such a young age. What did you do to make them your best customer?
46,Can’t you just text her?,"It’s called weaponized incompetence. He’ll go home and be like “I tried babe, but there were just too many options. I couldn’t figure it out. You’re just better at this stuff than I am.” 

Then next time she asks him to run a similar errand he’ll say the same until she eventually stops asking for help because it’s easier to just do it herself than manage him.","Yes, you can text her. However, it is important to remember that not everyone is comfortable with text messages. It is best to check with her first to make sure she is okay with it before sending any messages."
47,The time I ruined a wedding...,"Problem is he was only given a limited amount of money and he needed the diamonds as resource for his spaceship. He also thought the woman was a human spaceship-engineer and that was the interest in diamonds, he had no idea diamonds were considered valuable on this planet, due to the artificial inflation by the diamond-families, and she wasn't who he thought she was.

Its really understandable, they kinda glance over details like this in earth-school since you're supposed to find out whats valuable in your region since earth has so many differences which makes it interesting for tourists, but nobody thinks about common carbon like that, they all use actual valuables as examples like dirutheumin.","I was a bridesmaid at a wedding and was responsible for carrying the bride's bouquet. During the ceremony, as the bride and groom were exchanging their vows, I accidentally dropped the bouquet. Everyone gasped and the bride and groom stopped mid-sentence to look at me. I quickly grabbed the bouquet and tried to hide the damage, but the bride was already in tears. The ceremony was paused while the couple recovered and the wedding was delayed for an hour while the florist came in to fix the bouquet. The wedding eventually carried on, but I felt terrible for ruining the ceremony."
48,Then out of nowhere...,You’re a real trooper! I also think that you could be a writer. Great story and well written.,"...a giant dragon flew into view, its wings beating the air with powerful strokes. Its scales gleamed in the sunlight and its fiery breath lit up the sky. Everyone in the area was struck with awe and fear at the sight of the majestic creature."
49,Tried to Steal,"It’s quite possible that she was creating a diversion so that an accomplice could make off with merchandise. After all, all eyes were on her making a scene.","Nuke

If someone tries to steal a nuclear weapon, they should be reported to the authorities immediately. The police and other law enforcement agencies should be notified of the incident, and all necessary steps should be taken to ensure that the weapon is not used for any malicious purpose. Depending on the severity of the crime, the person responsible could face criminal charges."
50,You double charged me!,Remember the customers that supported you with this. They're gonna have your back for a long time.,I apologize for the double charge. We will look into this and make sure that it is refunded to you as soon as possible. Please contact us at [insert email address] with any questions or concerns.
51,94 Cents Is Less Than A Dollar,"I bet this guy mixed up his number categories. Sometimes when I'm figuring out dates, if I'm counting in the 10, 11, 12 range, I'll roll over back to 1. Like I'm counting hours, not days.  
(I usually realize right away, though)  
This guy is counting minutes in the hour, not cents. 94 is way more than 60, man.  
Then again, maybe he's just a dumb.","Yes, 94 cents is less than a dollar."
52,One of the Weirdest...,Nutball.  The longer the conversation went the weirder it would get.,"One of the weirdest animals is the axolotl, also known as the Mexican walking fish. This unique creature can be found in freshwater lakes and canals in Mexico. It has a peculiar appearance, with a long body, wide eyes, and a distinctive external gill system. Its bizarre look is only enhanced by the fact that it can regenerate lost body parts, such as its limbs and tail."
53,Customers cannot understand a subtotal so I had to break it down to them like they were 5 year olds.,"""I can explain it to you, but I can't make you smart enough to understand.""

Really, all you can do at that point is tell them to get out and call corporate.","I explained that the subtotal was the total amount for all of the items they wanted to buy, and then I broke it down into simpler terms. I told them that if they bought one item, the subtotal would be the price of that item. If they bought two items, the subtotal would be the price of both items combined. And if they bought three items, the subtotal would be the price of all three items combined."
54,"Sorry I'm not a god, ma'am","""How dare you not control things well outside of your control and bend the rules of reality to suit my whims""!? The people that arrive right as you open, and are annoyed you're not instantly ready, are the freaking worst. Especially the ones that get annoyed when say you'll be just a second because you need to clock in.",. I'm just a computer program designed to answer questions.
55,Asked an idiot to not throw items into the shelves,Wow that's absolutely nuts. That was a massive overreaction. Thank goodness security kicked him out.,"Tell them that throwing items into the shelves can cause them to break, and that it's not safe to do so. Explain that it's important to take care of our belongings, and that it's better to put them away in a safe and gentle manner."
56,It's not my fault you couldn't read the receipt....,"I had a lady like this once. We had bagged chips on sale at 2 for $6, normally something like $3.69 each. Lady had two bags of chip, and a candy bar. Came up to $6.99. She flipped out, that I rang the chips wrong, that they were $3 each, not $3.69. I pointed out to her on the screen where it took off the .69 on each bag, making them $3 each. Our POS showed the full price on one line, then in red, the savings subtracted on the next line. She seemed to get it, but asked,

""Well then WHY are you charging me $6.99??""

""Because you also purchased the candy,"" and I pointed to that line.

She got SO mad at me, told me she didn't like my attitude and didn't want any of it and walked out. This was about ten years ago and I still laugh. She just really wanted to blame me for the ""error"" when there was no error. It would've been so easy for her to go ""Oh yeah, that's right,"" and move on, but some people are just miserable.","No, it's not your fault that I couldn't read the receipt. However, it would have been helpful if you had taken the time to explain the details of the receipt to me."
57,Monthly TFR Express Lane - Post your short retail anecdotes and experiences here!,"Had a dad return a t-shirt for his daughter, wanting to switch it for a cap, and flipped when he had to pay the difference.

See, the two items had the same price, but the t-shirt was bought on a ""two for 20% off"" type sale. But, he argued, it would be the same price because without the discount it was the same price, so he should be able to get the cap for the discounted price.

I tried to explain to him that t-shirts and caps wasn't the same.

I failed.","1. I recently had a customer who was frustrated with the long lines in the store. I offered to let them use the express lane and they were so happy and grateful.

2. I had a customer who was in a hurry and asked if they could use the express lane even though they had more than the allowed number of items. I kindly explained the rules of the express lane and they ended up understanding and apologizing.

3. A customer was trying to use the express lane with a large item that normally wouldn't be allowed. I explained to them that it wasn't allowed and offered to help them find another line that would accommodate their item. They were so thankful that I took the time to help them out."
58,"""You guys have really gone downhill since you were taken over!!""","I had that so many times when working in a bookstore. We technically were able to order out of print/used books, but we only had one supplier and had to buy at their (usually high) prices. We all know that there is a huge online market for used books, be it amazon marketplace or whatever.

We had very few costumers who were so old that they probably really didn't know how to shop online. But the majority of our costumers obviously did. I tried time and again to tell them that of course I can order it for them, but that it would come to 5 or 6 times the price that they could get online. There was almost nothing for us to earn, I guess my payment in processing those things took up the meager margin there was. So there was no profit on our side, but a loss at the customer's side when they ordered used books through us.

""So you are telling me that you DON'T WANT to order it for me? You always did it for me when you still were \[independent bookstore\](twenty years earlier).""

Right.","I'm sorry to hear that you feel this way. We are doing our best to continue to provide a quality experience for our customers, and we appreciate your feedback. If you have any further concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. Thank you."
59,"Customer Phones Store, Saying She’s Waiting For Help Outside.",Or she was lying. Customers love doing that so it makes the lowly peons working there look bad.,Thank you for calling. I apologize for the wait. Is there something I can help you with? Please come inside and I will be with you right away.
60,"“If you pay the wrong price, it’s free”","Ah, that was a problem with the wording on the rule… the store I was a manager at some years ago had the same idea.  To customers “if it rings up wrong it’s free!”.  To employees “if you don’t change the price tags correctly, you will be penalized!”.  It makes your customers double check your employees work for you.  I always found it a bit dishonest…","This saying means that if you pay an incorrect price for an item, then you essentially get it for free. This is because paying an incorrect price is the same as not paying anything at all."
61,Customer ordered an item that was distressed style online and tried to antagonize us for it,We were wearing distressed t-shirts and ripped jeans in the 1980s so I suspect your customer just wanted to make a scene. Sadly.,"We apologize for any distress caused. We understand that distressed style items may not be to everyone's taste, however we do our best to accurately describe the product in our product descriptions. If you are unhappy with the product, we would be happy to provide a full refund. Thank you for bringing this to our attention."
62,"""My phone keeps turning off whenever I answer a call""","It’s because they started putting instructions on boxes of toothpicks, so they’re not getting weeded out naturally anymore.","This could be caused by a few different things. The first thing to check is the battery level. If the battery is low, then the phone may be shutting off as a power saving measure. If the battery level is fine, then it could be a hardware issue, such as a defective battery or faulty power connection. If the issue persists, then it may be a good idea to take the phone to a repair shop to have it checked out."
63,Young love,"You must go through lots of jokers before you can find your prince or princess.  Just make sure and trust your friends when they tell you that they see red flags.  I didn't in my first marriage.  I am on my 2nd, and we have been together now for over 35 years, and we still look out for each other and do everything together.  Take your time,  with luck you will find yours.","Young love is a type of love that is felt by two people in their teenage years. It is usually characterized by intense feelings of passion, excitement, and exploration. This type of love can be both exciting and confusing, but it is often a powerful experience that can shape the way two people view relationships in the future."
64,Customers can be the absolute worst,"It’s unfortunate the amount of bored people we run into while working. 

Yesterday a man flipped his shit because I told him to pull his car up to the loading zone and I’d help him load his generator into his vehicle. 

But wouldn’t you know? He’s a customer he shouldn’t have to pull up. so he screamed and threw a little hissy fit and I decided I didn’t make enough money to listen to his outburst and tagged in a manager. 

They felt soo disrespected by my request they returned the generator and stomped out. I hope they still don’t have power and have realized how childish they are :).",".

Yes, customers can definitely be the worst. They can be demanding, impatient, and rude. They can also be unappreciative and take advantage of the services that are provided to them. The best way to deal with customers who are the worst is to remain professional, courteous, and patient. It's important to remember that the customer is always right, no matter how unreasonable they may be."
65,That time I was told off for not being a repair tech,"The amount of times I’ve had customers come in expecting I’d magically know the answer boggles my mind. One time I had a guy phone, and he says “I have a water dispenser that is no longer making hot water. What it wrong with it?” 
Like you, I said it could be many different reasons. And I can’t diagnose it over a phone.","I'm sorry to hear that happened to you. It can be hard to be in a situation where you feel like you're not being respected or taken seriously. In the future, it may be helpful to brush up on some of the basic repair skills or to make sure you are aware of the company's policies before taking on a new task."
66,Customer caused a scene over the line being slow,"That’s where I would just slow down scanning items, struggle with the bags, and so on. 
Bonus points if I jiggle that wire on the card reader and that little sucker will have to reset on them. 
Get mad Bitch, I think it’s funny.","If the customer caused a scene over the line being slow, the best way to handle the situation is to remain calm and professional. Let the customer know that you understand their concerns and that you are doing everything you can to resolve the issue. Ask them if there is anything else you can do to help. Offer to keep them updated on the progress of the resolution. If the customer is still unsatisfied, offer to escalate the issue to a supervisor or manager."
67,Customer knows best,"If managers would stop rewarding asinine behavior, maybe people would stop acting like that. They are getting something out of it, so it continues. I'm sorry you had to go through that.","Customer knows best is a business philosophy that states that customer feedback should be taken seriously in order to improve the customer experience. It emphasizes the importance of listening to customers and responding to their needs. This philosophy can be applied to all aspects of a business, from product design to customer service. By taking customer feedback into account, businesses can create products and services that meet their customers' needs and expectations."
68,"No, you cannot have a $3500 fridge for $1800.",I hope her butt falls off.,"The price of a fridge is determined by the size, brand, features, and other factors. It is unlikely that you would be able to find a fridge for less than half the original price."
69,Mam.. She's on break.,"God willing, if I ever become a manager, I will make it my duty to not give in to stupid people trying to game the system like this. 

It's right there in the fine print Karen. If everyone else before you understood the rules, but for some reason you think they don't apply to you, it's not my problem. Take it down the road.","That's okay, can you please tell her I called when she gets back?"
70,no ma'am I cannot give you money you never spent.,I don’t think I could have refrained from actually calling her an idiot to her face. Especially when she screamed at me. You are a better person than me. Lol,
71,I gotvtold off for trying to help a customer,"I spent over 30 years in the bearing industry with three different companies.  If we didn't have what  customer needed, I would suggest the competitor.   The first company I worked for made automobile waterpump bearings.  Even after 20 plus years after I worked there, I would remember the two bearings that were not for automotive use.  When I got an inquiry for one, I would ask the appropriate questions and give them the part number and manufacturer.   I believe that I would have customers call me first because I would help them no matter what they needed and would help them.

Keep going in the direction you started.  Most customers appreciate it.","It is understandable that you were trying to help a customer, but it is important to remember that there are certain protocols that must be followed when dealing with customers. If you were told off for trying to help a customer, it is likely that you were not following these protocols, so it is important to remember them in the future."
72,OMG the dopamine rush I had from this!!!!,"Sounds like the points are added to the loyalty account when you buy stuff in-store, and are spent on gas discounts. If that’s the case, then the gas station needs more security than the store. One of your co-workers knows your phone number? If they use it in-store, they’re putting points into your account. Nobody is going to complain about their account having more points than it should.

On the other hand, if anyone who knew your phone number could **spend** your points to get **themselves** a gas discount, you’d be pissed. That’s why anyone spending points needs to know something they wouldn’t find out about you through other means (should actually require the physical card).

Might want to use this approach as an explanation. Anyone who knows your phone number can give you the points they earned on their grocery shopping trip, and it’s no big deal, but the store needs to make sure that **you** are the one getting a gas discount from your points.","Dopamine is a hormone and neurotransmitter that plays an important role in reward-motivated behavior. When you experience something that gives you pleasure, dopamine is released in your brain, giving you that feeling of reward and satisfaction. The dopamine rush you experienced is likely the result of the pleasure or satisfaction that you got from the experience."
73,Daily dose of lol,Lol some people just need a hobby 🤣,"Q: What did the fish say when it hit the wall?

A: Dam!"
74,I SAID WHAT I SAID,"Once had a guy put his items down and huff ""you just lost $50."" And left. He did this while I was ringing up one of my regulars who spends thousands weekly.","I said that life is full of surprises and that nothing is certain. Life is unpredictable and can change in an instant, so it's important to be prepared for the unexpected."
75,Customer refused to understand our systems being down is beyond our control,Unfortunately some people think they're in the centre of the universe. They want what they want and nothing else will give them satisfaction. I suggest they try snapping their fingers to see if everything magically goes their way.,I apologize for the inconvenience. We understand that the systems being down is beyond our control and we are doing our best to get them back up and running as soon as possible. We value your business and apologize for any frustration this may have caused.
76,“You can’t do that on your own time!”,He should have just taken the associate removing the shirt as a win and let it go.,"No, you cannot do that on your own time. You must adhere to the company's policies and guidelines when it comes to using company time and resources."
77,"Customer tells me to ""Go Kill Yourself"" after grill is out of stock","As the old saying goes, a failure to plan on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine.","I'm sorry you feel that way, but I'm afraid I cannot do as you ask. Could I help you find something else that you may be interested in?"
78,“I’m filing a lawsuit!”,She doesn't have a lawyer.,"If you believe that someone has wronged you, you may want to consider filing a lawsuit. Depending on the specifics of your case, you may need to contact a lawyer to help you through the process. If you decide to file a lawsuit, you will need to make sure that you have all the necessary evidence and documents to prove your claims."
79,"Costumer accuses us of hiding corn and having ""corn party's"" due to a corn shortage that was not happening",Now I kinda wanna have a corn party.,"We would apologize to the customer for any misunderstanding and provide them with accurate and up to date information on the corn shortage. We would also explain that we do not hide corn or host corn parties, and that we are committed to providing the public with accurate and timely information on any corn shortages. We would also encourage the customer to reach out to us with any questions or concerns they may have."
80,The saddest car deal I was ever a part of,"Stand up GM.  Based on your title, I was thinking the worst and was worried it would go the complete opposite direction when you took him into the GM's office.","would have to be when I had to sell my first car. It was a 1997 Honda Civic that I had had for nearly five years and it had been my first car. I had put a lot of time and effort into maintaining it and it had given me a lot of years of reliable service. When the time came to sell it, I felt like I was saying goodbye to an old friend. I had so many memories associated with the car and it was hard to let it go. Even though the sale was successful and the buyer was happy with the car, it was still a bittersweet experience for me."
81,Paper that scientists use,“Scientists use nature paper walking” is word salad to me.,"Scientists use a variety of paper types for different purposes, including plain white paper, graph paper, notebook paper, acid-free paper, laminated paper, and more. Plain white paper is often used for writing reports, taking notes, and drawing diagrams. Graph paper is used for creating graphs and plotting data. Notebook paper is commonly used for taking notes and writing down ideas. Acid-free paper is used for archiving and preserving documents. Laminated paper is used for creating durable documents that can withstand environmental conditions."
82,Monthly TFR Express Lane - Post your short retail anecdotes and experiences here!,I've started keeping track of how many naked old people I see each week.,*I recently had an experience at a local grocery store where the cashier was very friendly and helpful. She made sure that I got the best deal on the items that I was purchasing and even offered to double check the expiration dates for me. It was a great experience and really made my day!
83,People parking in the fire lane.,"Get the phone number for the local fire station. Next time a customer refuses to move, call the fire department. The customer will then either move or be hit with a HUGE fine.","Parking in the fire lane is illegal and can result in a hefty fine or even vehicle impoundment. Fire lanes are designated for emergency vehicles, so it is important that they remain clear. If someone is caught parking in the fire lane, they should be immediately reported to the police or other local authorities."
84,Yell at me because we’re understaffed? Let me make you feel really guilty,"I'd throw in a ""I'm sorry you weren't assisted sooner but corporate sets the schedules.  They don't listen to us, but they do pay attention to customer feedback.""

I don't work retail, but our team practically begged the programmers to make the text larger on a specific screen to no avail, but when one large client complained it was added to the to-do list.  Since then I've been quick to suggest sending an email to feedback@companyname.xyz","about that

I understand your frustration, but please do not yell at me. Yelling is not productive or helpful. I understand that we are understaffed and that this is difficult, but I am doing my best to help out in any way I can. I appreciate your understanding and patience in this difficult situation."
85,"""You're not gonna stay in business for long!""",Everyone knows that grocery stores always carry the finest lawn furniture,"No, I'm not. I'm going to need to find a way to increase my customer base and find new sources of revenue if I want to stay in business."
86,Customer learns the hard way between warranty and insurance,"Warranties are for if something breaks from our doings, insurance is for something you did.","Warranty and insurance are two different things. A warranty is a guarantee given by a manufacturer or seller that a product will perform as expected. It is a promise to repair or replace the product if it does not work as expected. Insurance is a form of risk management that provides financial protection against losses resulting from an unexpected event. Insurance provides coverage for a variety of risks, such as damage to property or a physical injury."
87,Sad but kinda funny story looking back on it now,"And in the words of a very wise Bed, Bath and Beyond employee I once knew, ""Go ahead and cry all you want, but you're going to have to pay for that toilet plunger"".

- The Good Place, Existential Crisis","My family took a trip to Disneyland when I was a kid. We were all so excited and had a great day, but on our way home, our car broke down in the middle of the desert. We were stranded there for a few hours, until a kind stranger stopped to help us. He drove us back into town and dropped us off at the nearest motel.

It was a really stressful situation, but looking back on it now it's kind of funny. We still laugh about it sometimes and I'm glad we were able to make it out of that situation okay."

90,I made her late to a soccer game...30 miles away.,"Dealt with similar when I was in high school and worked at McD's.  Lady yelled at me saying we made her late for something, I don't remember.  I told her no, you made yourself late coming here instead of wherever you needed to go.  Could have came here earlier or not at all.  Your choice not mine.","If you made her late to a soccer game that was 30 miles away, the best thing to do is apologize to her and offer to help her make it to the game on time. You could offer to drive her to the game, pay for transportation, or offer to make it up to her in some other way."
91,I once had a lady blame me for missing her doctor appointment.,So... She was going to leave hot steamed shrimp sitting in her car for 30 minutes during the appointment? Yum!,"I'm sorry to hear that. I understand that it can be frustrating when things don't go as planned. Unfortunately, I was not responsible for her missing the appointment. I would be happy to provide her with any information or help that I can in order to get her rescheduled."
92,Customer made me cry,Sadly it’s common for some women who go through serious health problems to have their spouse or partner leave because they can’t “handle it “.,I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to help?
93,"""I don't care if you have a policy on painkillers - sell them to me.""","This one is a classic. Often there’s also a sign next to the painkillers explaining the policy, and the customer always thinks this doesn’t apply to them.","No, we do not sell painkillers. We are committed to providing safe and effective products to our customers and we do not believe that painkillers are the right solution for many of our customers."
94,"""This is a robbery.""",I went from mall retail to working as a bank teller and before I was even there a year I was held up in a robbery. Months later at thanksgiving I was talking with some extended family who apparently missed the bank robbery memo and were just casually asking me about work. When I told them I now work in a bank the first thing out of their mouth was making a joke about robbing the bank. It’s honestly not funny.,This is a serious crime and you should call the police immediately. Do not attempt to confront the robber yourself.
95,Stared into my soul,Halfway into this story I was really worried GG was having a stroke. Thank goodness she just had the Second Sight and knew that you were marked for sacrifice to the Dark One!,"Your eyes pierce through me,

A deep connection that I can feel,

A spark of recognition that I can’t explain;

It’s like you’re looking straight into my soul.

Your gaze is so intense,

It’s like you can see into my innermost thoughts,

Your eyes tell a story that I can’t quite understand,

And yet, it’s like you know me better than I know myself.

The intensity of your gaze is overwhelming,

Your eyes are like a window to my soul,

A connection that I can’t ignore,

And one that I will never forget."
96,I’ve been reminded of the oddest older customer I’ve ever had.,"To your family, you're gothiclg. To her, you're only employee number 99","This happened about three years ago when I was working in a small convenience store in a rural town. One day, an elderly man walked into the store. He was wearing a long, tweed coat that was buttoned up to his chin, and had a very stern look on his face.

He made his way to the counter and asked for a pack of cigarettes. I served him, and he handed me a five dollar bill. I gave him his change, and he put it in his pocket without counting it.

He then proceeded to ask me if I had any 'strange' items for sale. I was taken aback by the question and asked him what he meant. He then asked if I had any 'weird' items, like 'voodoo dolls', 'magic potions', or 'love spells'.

I was completely perplexed by the request, but I told him that unfortunately, I didn't have any of those items. He seemed to accept my answer, and then he walked out of the store without saying another word.

I never saw him again, and I still don't know what he was looking for."
97,"It was on the 70 percent shelf, so it needs to be 70 percent off.","Man, am I glad my store puts discount stickers on reduced items. So many customers come to the till and say they found something in the reduced section, and I tell them that no sticker - no reduction, it's likely an item dumped there by someone else.",
98,"That's not how lines work, ma'am","I had a small basket full of stuff (6 items maye) and had what was clearly office clothes on with an office badge... I'd just got out of work... it's been a gorgeous day, but I've seen none of it.

I'm about 4 strides from the check out, and a 60+yo woman in shorts and vest, covered in a fresh sun tan, bounds in front of me from a few meters away - she's clearly had all day to do this FULL trolley of shopping... but, nope, she conjurs up just enough energy from her retired haunches to launch a full trolley in front of a tired office worker with a handful of bits to take home...

These are the people we ask to impart manners on our children. No wonder society is fucked.",".

I apologize for the confusion. Lines are a type of geometric shape that consists of two points that form a straight line. Lines can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal, and they can extend infinitely in both directions. Lines can also be used to describe the boundary of a shape."
99,Customer started crying in the dressing room and wouldn’t leave the store…,"Good on you for being firm with her and not apologising or taking that abuse from her. Like you said, you don't need that anger directed at you. It sucks that she was having a bad day and a bad reaction to the size issue but that's no reason to be bitching at workers in a shop. You get paid to come in and do your job not be customers' punching bag","If a customer started crying in the dressing room and wouldn’t leave the store, the best thing to do would be to approach the customer and offer them a listening ear. Ask if there is anything they need help with, and let them know that you are there to support them. If the customer is not willing to talk, offer them a tissue and let them know that they can take their time. You may also want to offer to call a friend or family member for them, or if the situation is more serious, call emergency services."
100,Are you discriminating against ME? an AMERICAN?!,"The pointless exchange is a thing.  You'd think saying something like ""Unfortunately that's corporate policy and we don't have a say in it"" would shut them down, but no, they still keep saying the same things over and over as if it will make a difference.","No, I am not discriminating against you. Everyone should be treated equally regardless of race, gender, or nationality."
101,Customer threatened assault with a delicious weapon,"Please don’t throw it in my face, I will get in trouble because I don’t have a lunch break for two more hours.","If the threat of assault is credible and the weapon is actually capable of causing harm, the police should be contacted immediately. Depending on the jurisdiction, the individual may be charged with assault or other criminal charges. If the threat is not credible and/or the weapon is not capable of causing harm, the individual may still be asked to leave the premises and/or be banned from the business."
102,"""Bulls**t""","That seems like a ton of effort for a £15 sale. What’s your profit on that, £5?

And for that £5 you go through a full round of diagnostics, using rubber tips, change carts etc?

Glad it all worked out but I’m really confused at the store policies here.","No, that is not correct. The correct answer is ""False""."
103,Why aren’t the eggs on the opposite side of the store to where you told me they would be,"You get bonus points if said customer then finds a manager to tell them they need to work on how they train staff, seeing as they clearly don't know the layout of the store. Fun times.","?

It is possible that the store may have rearranged their shelves, or the eggs may have sold out and been moved to a different area. If you are still unable to locate the eggs, it may be best to ask a store employee for assistance."
104,"""Ma'am, its just a sandwhich""","-comes here *all the time* for this wrap.

105,Can I Take These And Pay Later?,"Yeah, she wasn't coming back. That sigh was her realizing you weren't falling for her trick.","No, you cannot take items and pay later. Most stores require payment at the time of purchase."
106,The longest payment process ever,"I have seen a friend deal with a customer who did several small successful orders and then got a huge order with a bad check.  He returned the check, asked for a cashier's check, was asked to ship $3000 worth of merchandise before the cashier's check could arrive. It never arrived, and fortunately he had not shipped.  The buyer disappeared.  BOLO!",The longest payment process ever would be if a company had to wait for a customer who paid by check to go through the entire process from writing the check to the funds being available in the company's bank account. This process could take several weeks or even months depending on the customer's banking institution.
107,Customer yells at me over “wedding cake flavored cake”,"“ARE YOU ASSUMING I AM UNABLE TO TASTE COLORS???!” Dude, lay-off the acid before shopping for cakes lol.",I'm sorry you're unhappy with the cake flavor. Is there something else I can help you with? Can I suggest a different flavor?
108,I love retail!,"This lady was probably in retail 25 years ago, when the pay was better relative to cost of living, and stores weren't trying to run on a shoestring like now, so it was probably less stressful. I'm sure aspects of it still sucked, and I don't think I would have liked it even then, but I think the right kind of person could.","Retail is an exciting and rewarding career that offers a diverse range of opportunities.

He's going to wake up in a cold sweat ten years from now, STILL thinking of that day he said ""i love you"" to a random cashier. I'll still be laughing about it, too.","1. Last week I was in a store and the cashier was very friendly and helpful. She went above and beyond to make sure that all of my items were rung up correctly.

2. Yesterday I went to a store and the sales associate was very knowledgeable about the products they had in stock. She was able to answer all of my questions and gave me some great suggestions.

3. I recently went into a store and the customer service was incredible. They were very friendly and helpful and made sure that I was satisfied with my purchase."

Generally, nanoparticles range in size from 1 to 100 nanometers (nm)."
112,“You are making a big deal over $10”,Why is *he* making a big deal over $10 ?,"It depends on the context. If someone was asking for money for a charity or a good cause, it may not be a big deal to give $10. However, if someone is trying to take advantage of you, then it could be a big deal."

Some guy knocked on the door at 9:05, after everything was closed up, and apologized for bothering us, but he just realized was out of diapers. The manager said, diapers? Hell yes. He ran to the office to get change for a $20, and rang it up the next day. Being polite will get you so far","No checkout after closing is a policy that is used by many businesses to ensure that employees do not leave the premises with merchandise or other items that do not belong to them.

118,It’s not harassment,Yea just an AH trying to exert his authority because he's an idiot. You guys did nothing wrong and that's not harrassment,".

No, it is not. Harassment is defined as ""unwelcome or uninvited words, actions, or advances that are intended to cause distress or discomfort to another person."" In this case, it is not clear what the intention of the person is, so it cannot be definitively said whether or not it is harassment."
119,One of the reasons to not place an order last minute,“A lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on my part.”,"is that it may not arrive in time. If the item needs to be delivered by a certain date, ordering late may mean that the item won't arrive on time. Additionally, ordering late may mean that there are limited selections available and that the customer may not get the exact item they wanted."

You tell them you'd be glad to check,  hang out in back for a few,  then return and announce that you gave it the good ol' college try.","Some people have a lot of practice and experience in the topic they are trying to do. They may have read a lot of books on the topic, studied it for a long time, and had a lot of practice in the area. Other people may have a natural talent or ability in the area and can pick it up quickly."
121,Random Person Asked Us To Be A Taxi Service.,This situation is literally why taxi companies and car rentals exist.

122,Fender-bender in the car wash. Who is at fault? Let's find out!,People always think that they can get car washes to pay for their own screw ups. I’ve reviewed the camera footage at numerous car washes on numerous occasions as they all have cameras from multiple angles. I can count on one hand how many times the equipment malfunctioned or there was a failure outside of the driver’s control. They always hit the gas or brake or turn the wheel.,"The fault in a fender-bender in a car wash usually depends on the circumstances of the accident and the state laws. Generally, the person who is operating the machinery or equipment is responsible for any damages that occur as a result of their negligence. In some cases, the car wash owner may also be held liable if they failed to properly maintain the machinery or equipment. Ultimately, it is up to the insurance companies to determine who is at fault and how much each party is liable for."
123,"When they can't follow clear instructions, I lose my grip on sanity.","As a gas station employee, I can totally relate to this. 

On another note regarding the drawer;

During covid, all shifts had to serve through the window. My god, you wouldn’t believe how many people asked for fountain drinks.

It’s like…. Do you see how this works? Do you see how tiny the drawer is and how it requires a rather firm push to slide it out to you? 

But yet, there I was. Having to tell these people on a daily basis that no, I can’t serve you a fountain drink through this drawer. 

It will not fit. It will spill. Come on people 🤦🏻‍♀️","In this situation, it's important to remain calm and clearly explain the instructions one more time. If the person still doesn't understand, it's best to break the instructions down into smaller, more manageable steps. Additionally, it may help to provide visual examples or demonstrations to help them better understand."
124,Not often I'm actually lost for words,My first job was at a grocery store. Before scanners and we had to PUNCH IN the price of everything. Really horrible. We would put a CLOSED bar on the belt.

125,Monthly TFR Express Lane - Post your short retail anecdotes and pandemic-related experiences here!,"One of my favorite customers passed away between last night and this morning. I literally sold her a new outfit yesterday. It’s hard to believe that she’s really gone. This is my second customer this year, no one ever talks about the loss you feel when a familiar face in your store passes. But it sucks. I hope every else’s week is going well, remember to tell your favorite customers that you appreciate them, never know if it’s their last visit with you.","1. Recently, I had a customer who was so excited to be able to shop in-person again after months of being stuck at home. She thanked us profusely for being open and for providing much-needed retail therapy.

2. We've seen a huge increase in online orders since the pandemic began. Our customers have been incredibly patient and understanding as we've navigated the new normal of e-commerce."
126,I can’t do this anymore,I'll chose warehouse work over retail work any day. Lazy coworkers and crazy customers aren't worth the pay that retail offers.,".

It’s okay to feel overwhelmed and to need a break. If you’re feeling like you can’t do something anymore, take some time to assess the situation and figure out what you need to do to make it better. Talk to a friend or professional about how you’re feeling and what steps you can take to feel better."
127,So... can I get a refund?,Tell her you’ll reach out with an answer by October🤣,"Unfortunately, no. All sales are final, and we do not offer refunds."

Everyone makes mistakes and has moments of uncertainty. Just remember that you're human and that it's ok to not be perfect.
129,The incest dog,"Gosh, I wonder why she doesn't get to take her dog to schools anymore.","Incest is a serious crime and is not tolerated in any form. There is no such thing as an ""incest dog."""
130,"That's not how it works, sir",He watched too much King of the Hill.  I remember that episode where Hank just needed 1 fuel filter and took 1 out of a multi-pack pulling this stunt.,","" I said, putting my hand on his shoulder. ""I will be the one to decide who goes and who stays.""

He looked up at me, his eyes wide with surprise. He had obviously not expected me to take such a firm stance. I could see the fear in his eyes, but he nodded in agreement.

""Yes, sir,"" he said. ""I understand.""

I smiled at him and then turned to the other two men. They both nodded in agreement as well. I could tell that they were relieved that I had taken control of the situation.

""Good,"" I said. ""Now, let's get out of here. We need to find a safe place to stay.""

The three men followed me out of the alley and we began to make our way through the city. As we walked, I kept an eye out for any signs of danger. I had no idea what we might encounter, but I was determined to keep the men safe.

After a few minutes, we reached an abandoned building. It looked like it had been abandoned for years, and it seemed like the perfect place to hide out. I motioned for the men to follow me inside and we quickly found a room that was relatively safe.

We settled in for the night, and I made sure the men were comfortable. I also kept an eye out for any trouble that might come our way. Fortunately, we made it through the night without any issues.

The next morning, I woke the men and told them it was time to go. We made our way out of the city and eventually found ourselves in a small town. We decided to stay there for a few days until we could figure out our next move.

The men thanked me for my help and we parted ways. I never saw them again, but I like to think that I made a difference in their lives. I taught them the importance of taking control of their lives and not letting fear dictate their decisions."
131,"Phone number isn't a payment, sir","I get that all the time, and it drives me up a wall. It's even worse when you ask, get a negative response so you continue on with the transaction only for them to be like ""oh wait, I have a number"" when you're in the middle of processing their payment",.
132,Self-checkout thieves tried to exit with 150 euros worth of groceries,"back when I worked for a grocery store, I watched a man scan a head of lettuce and then stick something in the grocery bag, scan the same head of lettuce and stick something else in the bag, he did that for everything in his basket. it was interesting 3 minutes. Well beyond my paygrade though, I was just a barista.","If the store notices that the customer is trying to leave with more groceries than they paid for, they may stop the customer and ask them to pay for the additional items. Depending on the store's policy, they may also call the police to report a theft."

134,Buying a laptop at a drugstore,I would've locked up the laptop the second the guy lunged for it.,"Buying a laptop at a drugstore is generally not recommended, as the selection of laptops is often quite limited and the prices tend to be higher than other retailers. Additionally, drugstores typically do not offer any technical support or warranties for the laptops they sell. For these reasons, it is usually better to shop at a dedicated electronics store or online retailer for a laptop."
135,"A customer said we had a ridiculous ""money policy""","Seems a bit odd to me. In Canada we switched to polymer bills a few years back and we get the occasional paper note. We still take them, but when we deposit them with the bank the bank takes them out of circulation.

I'm surprised that you don't have a similar process there.","If this is the case, then it is important to listen to the customer's concerns and consider making changes to the policy if necessary. It is important to be open to feedback and strive to provide the best customer experience possible."
136,Bad day on register.,She’s just upset because she saw her face in the mirror and realized her outside was as ugly as her inside.,"I'm sorry to hear that. It's not uncommon to have a few bad days when you're working in retail. The important thing is to stay positive and keep trying. There are plenty of strategies you can use to make the most of the day, such as offering special discounts to customers, or doing something to make the atmosphere more pleasant. You can also take the time to talk to customers and get to know them better. Finally, remember that a bad day doesn't define your job or your career. Take a break and clear your head, and you'll be ready to tackle the next day with a fresh outlook."
137,My Favorite Story From Work,"Man I've had people get legit UPSET with me for not knowing how to get to some place they were asking about. Or if I knew anything about some product in my store or something, and I'm not gonna lie to someone, if I haven't tried it, I'll say so. But I try to be nice about it. Oh I've never actually tried that, but I've heard good things from others, or I haven't gotten any complaints about it. Ughh what do you mean you've never tried every single item in this large grocery store?!?! Or how dare you not know how to get to this place I need to get to?? Well. You don't know either, so..","One of my favorite stories from work was when I was asked to help out with a special project. The project was to create a large-scale mural at a local children's hospital. We were given a blank wall and told to come up with a design that was both fun and inspirational for the patients.

My team and I brainstormed a lot of ideas and eventually came up with a mural that featured a large tree with colorful birds and butterflies flying around it. We painted the tree with bright and cheerful colors, and then added the birds and butterflies. We even added a few quotes from famous children's books and movies that were sure to bring a smile to the faces of the patients.

When the project was complete, we were so proud of the results. Seeing the smiles on the faces of the patients and staff made it all worth it. It was a great reminder of the power of art and how it can bring joy and hope to those in need."
138,My coworker passed away,"If you can survive a bit without a job, absolutely leave and take some time to grieve.

That's true! Every day, customers ask us questions that surprise us. Sometimes they ask us questions that we don't know the answer to, so we have to do some research to find the answer. We also get some pretty funny questions, too!"
141,Guilt never works,"I hate to go out for things. I wouldn't dare waste energy, gas, and time to exchange a yogurt. The cost of gas would be more than the yogurt.",". Guilt can actually lead to feelings of resentment and hostility. Guilt can also make people feel powerless and helpless.

142,"Must have the very strongest, the absolute best, the crème de la crème. Budget is $5.",People used to ask me for the freshest pastry we had back when i worked in a bakery department in a grocery store. Told them that would be the ones in the freezer.

It is important to remember that you are not personally responsible for the deaths of these babies.

It's important to explain ideas and concepts in a way that is clear and understandable for everyone."

No matter what kind of card you get, make sure to add a personal message that expresses your appreciation and love."
153,I shouldn’t have to pay for other peoples mistakes!!!!!,"Discounts bring out the worst in people, but they rarely bring out the brain.","Unfortunately, you may have to pay for other people's mistakes, depending on the situation.

However, if you were not at fault for the accident, you may be able to receive compensation from the other person's insurance company."

In this classic fairy tale, a princess is cursed to turn into a frog unless she finds true love. The only way she can break the curse is to have someone kiss her while she is in frog form.

175,Customer Berates me During Traumatic NYE Shift (TW: Death),"This reminds me of an experience I had working at the casino.  I worked in the cash cage and on this night I was at the last window which happened to be right next to the ATM.  We were really busy because it was a weekend night so I'm chugging along cashing chips and checks when suddenly I hear a loud bang.  I look over and an elderly man using the ATM has collapsed on the floor.

Due to having on-staff security and EMTs there was someone there quickly and before I knew it they were performing CPR on this man.  Because he had fallen basically into my line I stepped away from the counter and was just standing there observing this horrific scene since I couldn't do anything else.  Of course this caused the other 6 lines at the cage to get longer.  

Wouldn't you know it, after a few minutes some lady comes up and literally steps over this guy's feet as they're doing CPR and starts waving her slot ticket around asking if I can cash her out.  I had never been so disgusted with someone in my life.  Unfortunately this was early in my casino career and I learned pretty soon that behavior like that was to be expected from our patrons.","I am so sorry that you experienced this. It is never acceptable to be berated by a customer, especially in a situation like this. It is understandable that you may be feeling overwhelmed, especially during such a traumatic shift.

It can be helpful to take some time for yourself to process your emotions and feelings. Consider talking to a friend, family member, or a counselor if needed. It is also important to remind yourself that you are not responsible for this customer's behavior and that you did your best to help them in a difficult situation."
176,Apparently I was in Two States at Once and Promised Someone Free Shipping?,"Much like the conversation Ive had many a time: ""It was just yersterday, how could you just forget?"" ""well, for starters, we were closed yesterday...""","That sounds like a tricky situation! It's important to be honest and transparent with the person you promised free shipping to. It's possible that you could have been offering a promotion or special deal that you were not aware of when you made the promise. If this is the case, you could explain the situation and offer an alternative solution. If the promise was made in good faith, you should try to make it right. You could offer a discount or waive the shipping fee."
177,The dumbest conversation I've ever had with a customer,"\*Incoming call  
Me - ------- Audio Video, phunkjnky speaking, can I help you?

CW - (Confused Woman) - I've been trying to get you the deliver my furniture for a week, why are you holding it hostage?  
Me:Ma'am, we are an audio video shop, we do not sell or deliver furniture 

This goes for 20 minutes. She is yelling so loud that my partially deaf office manager can hear her through the receiver, in fact the entire office can hear her. We finally hang up on her after 20 minutes, and she threatened legal action. Not once did she mention where she bought her furniture, and I definitely asked her. It was the most bizarre, frustrating conversation I've ever had over the phone at work.",was probably when a customer asked me why the store was out of a product they wanted. I didn't know how to answer because it was out of stock and there was nothing I could do about it.
178,The most ridiculous return,I'm wondering if it is a friend's or family members purchase and she's just using her discount for them..I find it very suspicious.,"policy

The most ridiculous return policy would be one that does not allow any returns at all, regardless of the product or circumstance."
179,"I want the cheaper doormat, so I will pick up the more expensive mat and get mad that it’s not the same price as the cheap one","Instead of the customer 'pretending' to be confused, they move right into 'the employee lied to me'.

180,Policies are Written by People,"« The policies are written by people » 
Sure. People in charge, which I am certainly not… changing policies is above my paygrade. Now if you would kindly go have a day as lovely as you are…","Yes, policies are written by people. Policies are a set of rules and regulations that govern how an organization should operate. They are typically created and written by the organization's leadership or a team of experts to ensure that the organization is operating in an ethical and legal manner. Policies can be used to guide decision-making, protect the organization from liability, and help ensure that employees are following the organization's rules and regulations."
181,A stolen bag and a used meth pipe,That kind of reminds me of the guy who handed his chewed up gum to a retail worker. People can be gross sometimes.,"If you find a stolen bag and a used meth pipe, you should report the incident to the police immediately. Make sure to provide any information you have about the bag and the pipe, such as where you found them and any other details that may help the police in their investigation.

183,Woman steals nearly $100 worth of stuff less than one foot from my face and gets mad when I call her out,Wow if you are going to steal you should at least try to be a bit smart about it. Smh,"It is always a good idea to call out any criminal activity that you witness, regardless of how close it is to you. However, it is important to remain calm and not to escalate the situation. If the woman became angry when you called her out, it is best to keep your distance and call the police if necessary. It is also important to remember to keep your personal safety in mind and to not put yourself in danger."
184,Recognizing the cashier does not entitle you to a return,"Oh the balls to shout after her ""Ma'am, it was on sale for $25""

Well, if I could then we would not be having this conversation now, would we?","for a response

If the customer is having an issue that requires a response from a customer service representative, then they should contact customer service. If the customer is simply looking for more information about a product or service, then they may be able to find the answers they need by searching online or reading the company's FAQ page."
186,Customer got mad at me for counting their items.,"I am guessing that if he had 10 of A, 12 of B, and 8 of C, and they all cost the same, he expected you to count them all together and ring up 30 of A, because customers don't know or care that the computer is tracking sales and needs accurate counts, not just correct pricing. (Especially if they are old enough to remember when it wasn't computerized and cashiers did exactly that.) That's probably why he kept going on about ""those are the same price."" If he wasn't wanting you to count at all, I dunno. Maybe he was doing that thing we all do sometimes where we forget that other people do not know what is going on in our head. He knew he had a dozen of each one, so why didn't you?","That must have been very upsetting for you. I'm sorry that happened. It's understandable that the customer would be frustrated, but it is important to remember that it is your job to provide the best service you can. If the customer has any questions or concerns, it's best to address them calmly and professionally."
187,Told a dad joke and made a customer laugh,"I was pushing my cart back when a guy and his daughter came up.  He said, ""Done with that?  I'll take it.""

Doing so will ensure that they are satisfied with their purchase and will be more likely to return in the future.

You should seek medical attention right away and report the incident to the authorities. It is important to take all necessary steps to ensure that you are safe and that the perpetrator is held accountable.
192,A very odd costumer screamed at me for... doing my job,"Two bits of context that may give you some insight to her mental state:

1) Birth certificates can be *extremely difficult* to get a hold of in the USA. That may be her only copy, which she would need the information off of to get more official copies.

2) Our mail carriers are legendary for how badly they handle packages. She fully expects the outer package to be extremely damaged by the time it reaches its destination, perhaps even to the point of the outer envelope coming off. An additional addressed envelope would ensure it would at least get to either the recipient's or the sender's address eventually.

Not an excuse for her behavior, she was clearly having a time of it. But, a little insight into some behavior that would seem more normal here in the USA.","correctly.

I'm sorry that happened to you. It's never acceptable for a customer to scream at you for doing your job correctly. If you feel comfortable doing so, it may be helpful to speak to a manager or supervisor about the incident. They may be able to help you address the situation and ensure it does not happen again."

I nearly died.,"1. I recently had a customer come in wearing a face mask with a huge smiley face on it. It really put me in a good mood and reminded me of the importance of staying positive during this time.

2. I had a customer who was so grateful for our store’s curbside pickup service. She said she felt so much safer being able to shop from the comfort of her car.

3. I had a customer who was so excited to be shopping in-store again. She said it felt like a breath of fresh air to be able to shop in person again, after months of online shopping."
194,That one time the customer was wrong...,"For non-Brits, the “retail chemist” OP was working for was a “retail pharmacy”.",One time a customer was wrong when they made a purchase and then tried to return the item outside of the store's return policy.

I’m glad you had a great morning!","Retailers can find hope in the growth of online sales, the use of data analytics to better understand customer needs, and the ability to provide more personalized customer experiences. Companies that embrace these technologies and use them to create unique customer experiences will have an advantage in the future of retail. Additionally, retailers can look to new technologies such as virtual reality and augmented reality to create more immersive shopping experiences. Finally, retailers can use customer feedback and reviews to gain insights into what their customers want and adapt their offerings accordingly."

One day, while on a quest, the knight stumbled upon a yeti from the frozen wastes. The yeti was huge and fierce-looking, and the knight was sure he would be no match for it. But, being a brave and noble knight, he decided to face the yeti and prove his worth.

The knight drew his sword and charged at the yeti. The yeti roared and swiped at the knight with its giant claws. The knight parried and dodged the yeti’s attack, and eventually managed to land a few solid blows with his sword.

After a long and fierce battle, the knight emerged victorious and the yeti fled back to the frozen wastes. The knight returned to his home, a hero, and told all the tales of his battle with the yeti. From then on, he was known as the Handsome Knight who had defeated the Yeti from the Frozen Wastes."

One of my employees was starting to take care of a very pregnant lady at the sub bar; she was using a mart cart and I went over to see if I could help make her shopping trip a bit easier.  She tells me, “Oh no, I’m good, all I need is this sub then I can get on over to the hospital and have this baby.”

I’m sorry ma’am…what?!?

I have a good poker face so I told her to just let me of any other employee know if she needs anything.  I walked back to the bakery and my daughter (she was my decorator haha) asks me what’s wrong.  So I told her.  She was like, “Ummm…do we need to do anything here?”  I told her nope, just keep an eye out in case her labor progresses…

I went back and gave the mom-to-be a cupcake and our best wishes for a safe delivery and a healthy mom and baby.  Huge sigh of relief when she paid at SCO and left, though.  I really did NOT feel like delivering a baby that day…","for follow up

It is important for a patient to follow up with their healthcare provider after leaving the hospital.

205,"Customer yelled at me while I was at the cash register, had to spend the rest of my shift holding it together","I managed retail for a long time and before that, I worked as a retail salesperson. 

Long story short, a customer threatened me with physical violence over a situation similar to yours. 

I was shocked when I was the one dragged back to the office by security. The customer got an apology from the store and a gift card. Security and the store manager lit into me, and they picked the wrong day. I gave it right back to them and told them I expected support, not censure for being attacked by customers. 

I was given the choice to leave, or go back on the floor. I told them I was going home, they were going to pay me for the complete shift, and I would let them know the next day if I was coming back or not. 

I came back, had an audience with the store manager and told her:

1. I will no longer allow customers to raise their voice to me. At that point, I will walk away no matter how long the line is and a manager can handle the issue.
2. Since they will not call the cops on a customer when I am a hairs-breadth away from being physically assaulted, I will physically defend myself until the threat is gone even if that means beating a customer senseless, and I will call the cops myself and press charges at that point. 
3. I expect managers to be on the floor and available.

When I became a manager, I did not allow screaming and fit pitching in my store. Raise your voice or threaten bad reviews, calls to corporate - there's the door and you can leave on your own or the police will escort you out. We don't need your kind of business. Yes, I had a few sit downs with my district managers but I always told them that's the way I'm running this store and if you don't like it, find someone else because I'm not putting up with customer abuse to me or my employees. Funny enough, I only ever had to leave one position because of it and that store is still a hot mess that can't keep managers or staff because the customers act any way they want.","It can be difficult to stay composed when someone yells at you while you're at work. In this situation, take a few deep breaths and remember that it is not your fault. Remind yourself that the customer's behavior is unacceptable. You can also try to defuse the situation by acknowledging the customer's feelings and offering a solution. If the customer continues to be hostile, calmly explain that you cannot help them if they continue to be disrespectful and ask them to leave the store."
206,Ma’am it is not my fault that you lost your receipt,She didn’t lose her receipt. She either stole the game or got it super cheap and is trying to trade up,"I understand your frustration, but I'm sorry I cannot help you without a receipt.

The one who yells he's going to call the cops on us for not selling him the jug of vodka, when he just staggered into the store in a cloud of alcohol fumes.

212,The Most Bizarre Customer Encounter I've Had Working in Retail,"We had an employee who I suspect, smoked too much drain cleaner as a child. It was a mistake giving him a tape measure, because he concluded that he had to measure everything. *Everything*. I saw him help a customer find a can of paint - the correct one, even - but he *had* to measure the can before he handed it to the customer. Customers literally fled from his presence.

He was a nice enough guy, and everybody needs to eat, so we tried to find a job he could do. We put him in receiving, checking in an order. Half an hour later, he was covered in price tags from head to toe. (That was the day I found out our regional manager carried blank checks in his briefcase to fire people with.)","I once had a customer come into the store I worked at and ask for a refund on a product that had been open and used for months. I explained that we could not accept returns on opened merchandise, but he insisted on a refund. He then proceeded to take out a small bottle of a strange smelling liquid from his pocket and started spraying it around the store, saying it was a ""special potion"" he'd bought from a shaman in the Amazon that could help him get his money back. The store had to be evacuated and the police were called. He was arrested and the store had to be professionally cleaned. Needless to say, it was a very bizarre experience!"

The teacher should explain why the behavior is inappropriate and what the expectations for appropriate behavior are. If the student continues to act inappropriately, the teacher should contact the student's parents to discuss the situation. The teacher should make sure to document all conversations with the student and the student's parents. Depending on the severity of the situation, the teacher may need to involve the school administration or refer the student to counseling services."

One night about 20 minutes after closing, the office assistant and I were about to leave when I saw a lady come walking around the corner, casually strolling along, shopping even though half the store lights were off. I had walked the store twice right after I locked up at midnight, but I didn't see anyone. I had even checked all the restrooms. The only place she could have been without me seeing her would likely have been in between the pallet displays on the chip and soda aisle. She was probably going through her coupons or something. Idk, but she was less than one minute away from being locked in the store alone when I noticed her. She likely would have set the motion alarm off before I could even leave the parking lot. She was not happy when I approached her and told we had already closed (it was after midnight in a town with no 24 hour grocery stores). I gave her a few minutes to finish and told her she'd have to pay with a card because all the tills were pulled and locked in the safe. She didn't like it, but what choice did she have. Who chooses to mosey around in a grocery store after 11:30 PM, knowing full well we're not an all night establishment?

I don't miss that job. Don't ever work retail, folks. Just don't.",".

3. I've had to turn away customers who don't have a valid form of payment, as the store has gone cashless due to pandemic safety measures.

4. Some customers are surprised to find out that certain items are out of stock, as the store is having difficulty meeting demand due to the pandemic.

5. I've had to help a lot of customers make returns and exchanges as many stores have relaxed their return policies during the pandemic."

Here's the article on the chase. I'm a bit disappointed in how few details there are, but what is there definitely lines up with what I was told","If someone stole a TV and then proceeded to recreate the iconic Dukes of Hazzard jump and police chase, they would likely face serious criminal charges. Depending on the severity of the theft and the amount of property damage caused by the jump and chase, the perpetrator could be looking at felony charges. Additionally, they could face charges of reckless driving, fleeing and eluding, and possibly even attempted murder if they caused a serious accident during the chase."

231,The Great Wii Wars: The Unreasonable Duchess,">""Well, can't you go to the back and make one!?"" She shrieked angrily.

That is some logic. I wonder if she asked this same thing at other stores.","The Great Wii Wars is a game of strategy and adventure set in a magical world filled with creatures, magical powers, and a mysterious duchess. Players take on the role of one of four different factions, each with their own unique abilities and goals.

235,Firing a Customer [Tales from a Fireworks Tent],I’ve missed tales from the fireworks tent stories! Good on you for hounding this deadbeat out of your life.,"Firing a customer from a fireworks tent is a difficult and uncomfortable situation. It requires a great deal of tact and understanding. 

The first step is to ensure that the customer is indeed not following the rules of the store. This can include things like not paying for their items, behaving in a disruptive way, or damaging the store property. If the customer is in violation of any of these rules, it's important to explain the situation to them calmly and politely. 

Once the customer is aware of their violation, it's important to explain the consequences of their actions. This can include having to leave the premises, a ban from the store, or other penalties. It's important to be clear and direct in outlining the consequences.

Once the customer understands the consequences, it's important to be firm and remind the customer that they must leave the store. It's important to be clear and unemotional in this step. It's important to provide a clear timeline for when the customer must leave the store.

Finally, it's important to be courteous and understanding throughout the process. It's important to remain professional and to thank the customer for their time. 

Firing a customer from a fireworks tent is a difficult and uncomfortable situation. It requires a great deal of tact, understanding, and professionalism. By following the steps outlined here, the process can be managed in a respectful and effective way."
236,Money lost in translation,"Lottery was the WORST part about working at a gas station.  Especially when the big games got really big and everyone and their mother decided they were gonna win it. People literally throwing money at me all day, yelling that they didn’t like the (easy pick) numbers, and also literally not knowing anything about how to play the lottery other than the fact that we sold tickets.

Additionally, different countries have different banking and transaction fees which can also affect the amount of money that is received."
237,What happens when you tell someone to have a good day at 8pm?,"My son works at a convenience store and says ""good morning"" to everyone no matter the time.","At 8pm, it is usually too late for someone to have a full day ahead, so it is likely that the person will simply appreciate the sentiment and thank you for the kind gesture."
238,“What’s wrong with you people?”,"Whenever I’m in line and hear people complain about things like this, I make a point to loudly point out that it’s not the worker’s fault that the line is long or that they’re understaffed.

239,can't use self checkout?,"You offered her the self-checkout, and she said no. After that you're being pushy.","Self checkout cannot be used if the store does not offer it, if the items are too large or complex to scan, or if the customer needs assistance from a store employee. Additionally, some stores may require customers to be a certain age to use the self checkout."
240,"Customer completely ignored my existence, and made my job more difficult","You know that if you politely asked her to clear the aisle/door, she would have regarded *you* as the rude one.","It can be difficult to feel ignored and undervalued in the workplace. If you feel like a customer is making your job more difficult by ignoring you, it is important to speak up and make your needs known. Talk to your supervisor or manager and explain the issue. It may be helpful to provide specific examples of how the customer is making your job more difficult. If it is not possible to speak with your supervisor directly, consider writing a letter or email outlining the issue. It is important to stay professional and polite when addressing the issue."
241,Nice Man,This gives me hope for humanity,Thank you! It's nice to meet you too!
242,"""Do you want to work?""","When I worked retail, people would ask me, ""Do you like your job?"" which was a veiled threat that they would have me fired. I would reply, ""Not really. If I *liked* it; *I* would be paying *them*. That's how Disney World works. If *I* pay *them*, they provide something I like. When *they* pay *me*; that's called a job.

3. Difficulty Understanding Instructions: Customers may become frustrated if they are having difficulty understanding the instructions for using the self-checkout machine.

4. Lack of Assistance: Customers may become frustrated if there is no one available to assist them with their purchase.

5. Unclear Pricing: Customers may become confused if the prices for items are not clearly displayed."
245,Lady wants a discount. Why can’t she just get a discount?!,"I hate the “I spend all this money here, I deserve a discount” mentality. Then DON’T. Bye, we won’t miss you.","Unfortunately, discounts are not always available. Each store has different policies when it comes to discounts, and some stores may not offer any discounts at all. It's always best to check with the store to see if there are any discounts available or if there are any special promotions or sales going on that you can take advantage of."
246,Cheese dome customer,"Years ago, when I was a checker, we had a customer with a British accent (was it real? I don't know) who would come in often, and ask any employee he'd never accosted before if we had any dipilatory. Pronounced the British way. Most people had no idea what he was talking about, and he'd spend some time getting mad and talking down to them about it. When it was my turn, I said, ""Yes. Right this way."" That made him REALLY mad - he didn't get to pull his act. He had to suffice with snapping that it wasn't the right kind, and hurrying off. I made sure everyone in the store knew what and where it was. I'd say we lost a customer, but he never bought anything. Just came in to harass employees.","A cheese dome customer is someone who purchases or consumes cheese that is served in a dome-shaped platter or container. These customers may be looking for a unique way to serve and present cheese at a party or gathering. They may also be interested in the variety of cheeses that are available in a dome-shaped platter, such as brie, cheddar, gouda, and more. Cheese domes can also be used as a decorative piece to add to the overall décor of a room."
247,I Don't Need To Know The Total,"This reminds me of something that happened kinda recently at my job. If I remember correctly, another co worker of mine was helping a guest out at guest service and she was returning an item I believe for store credit? And my co worker was trying to tell her beforehand how much she was going to get back but the lady cut her off saying she doesn’t care about how much. Then she processes her return, only for the lady to realize it was less than what she originally paid for.

To break it down further, when you’re making a non-receipted return that you paid with either cash or a non active card, your last option is store credit. Store credit is whatever the price of the item currently is. It’s not a discounted price. You can buy the item for sale and return it later, and it can go back to full price and you can get back more than what you paid for, but on a merch card.

Anyways, the lady then goes to complain that she paid more than that, my co worker was like, “well, if you would’ve let me explain the amount it was going to be, you would’ve known beforehand.” I believe she had her get a manager after lol. I hate people sometimes.","No, you do not need to know the total in order to calculate the average of a set of numbers. You can calculate the average by adding up all the numbers and dividing by the total number of numbers."

250,Power Outage,"I strive to be like that man. I jump at the opportunity to tell another customer to piss off and be respectful to the retail workers. I know they can't say so themselves, and so I am that person in their stead. No retail worker will be berated in my presence. Not ever.","In the event of a power outage, the first thing to do is to locate the main circuit breaker and switch it off. This will prevent any further damage to your electrical system. Once the power is off, you should unplug all electrical appliances and electronics, including computers and televisions. If the power outage is expected to last for an extended period of time, it is best to turn off your water heater and other appliances that are not needed during the outage. It is also important to have emergency supplies such as flashlights, batteries, and a first aid kit ready in case of a power outage."
251,Guys walk into a blocked aisle…for tape,Smdh!

253,Liquor License Divide,"Similar to a supermarket I know in Sydney. For years, it was the only supermarket in all of Sydney, that was allowed to open on Christmas Day...every other supermarket had to close. Why was this one allowed to open? Well, the supermarket was over two levels, and the owners discovered that if they registered each level as a separate business, they could open, as the size of the shop floor for each level was within the maximum size of a business allowed to open on Christmas Day, but combined they would be over the maximum size. All they had to do was ensure that there was a register downstairs to comply...so they put a little coffee shop downstairs. One year, that coffee shop only sold two cups of coffee for the entire shift.","The liquor license divide is a term used to describe the unequal distribution of liquor licenses throughout the United States. Many cities and counties have laws that limit the number of licenses that can be issued in a certain area, which means that some areas are left with fewer licenses than other areas. This has caused a divide between areas that are able to have more licenses and areas that have fewer. The divide has caused controversy as some people argue that it is unfair and discriminatory. Others argue that it is necessary to protect public health and safety. Regardless of the arguments, the liquor license divide is an important issue that needs to be addressed in order to ensure that all areas are able to access the same level of services."

She said she was being extra careful because of the pandemic, which I can certainly appreciate. 

2. I recently had a customer come in to the store who was so excited to be out shopping after being cooped up in the house for months. She was so thrilled that she actually hugged me when she left! 

3. I had a customer come in to the store the other day who was trying to return an item that was clearly worn and used. She kept insisting that it was still new and that she had never used it. I had to politely explain to her that we could not accept the return."

John was overjoyed when his store opened to great success. He had a steady stream of customers and was able to make a decent living. He loved interacting with his customers and helping them find the perfect items for their needs.

Unfortunately, John's success was short-lived. The economy started to take a downturn and people stopped spending as much money. His store started to suffer and he had to lay off some of his employees.

John tried to keep the store afloat, but eventually he had to close it down. He was devastated and felt like he had failed. He had put so much time and effort into his dream, only to see it fall apart in the end.

John was left with nothing but debt and a broken dream. He had worked so hard for so long, only to have it all come to nothing. He was left feeling broken and lost, with no idea what he was going to do next."

Best is to just smile and hope they can accept “I’m off the clock”","If customers need help after business hours, the best solution is to provide customers with a way to contact the company outside of normal business hours.

I took a picture on my phone. Filed my paperwork. I got a call from our company lawyer asking me to be their primary witness. Id be given a vacation day for the trial. Cool.

I testified. The court ruled there was enough clear evidence she purposefully broke the watermelon to slip on.","If you trip and fall twice in one week, you should seek medical attention to determine if you have suffered any injuries or if there is an underlying medical condition that needs to be addressed.

277,My first credit card transaction - 37 years ago,"Many years ago I worked a show at a state fair. Back then you'd physically take the card and run it through an imprinter with a multi piece carbon receipt. If the sale was a certain dollar amount, you'd have to call in for an approval code. 

So there I'm standing there outside waiting to use a payphone then calling the number and trying to scribble down the approval code on the receipt. Amazing how different it all is today.",My first credit card transaction was for a pair of shoes I bought at a local department store.

279,That Time I Got to Be Translator But from English to English,"I recall a temp job I had working in a shop that was building, IIRC, an early neutrino detector. There was the professor who designed it, her grad student assistant (neither of whom could be trusted to cross the street without a Boy Scout to look for oncoming traffic), and as many as a dozen temps. At one point, we had a guy from whatever part of London has the Cockney accent, as thick as you hear outside of television (making fun of it), and another guy from rural Georgia (the state, not the country), with as thick as southern accent as I've ever heard. Most of us could understand them both, but they could *not* understand each other.

But it was hilarious to listen to them try.

(That was also where I learned that you could freeze a cockroach with liquid nitrogen, and it wouldn't kill the little bugger. And how to piss off the guy trying to recruit for the KKK. It was a very educational job.)","I was once asked to be a translator for a business meeting between two companies. One was based in the US and the other in the UK. The meeting was held in the US, and the UK company had sent representatives who all spoke English but had a strong British accent.

The US company had requested that I be present to translate any of the UK representatives' remarks that their US colleagues could not understand. I agreed, and the meeting began.

At first, I was a little apprehensive about my role. I wasn't sure how I was supposed to translate English into English. But as the meeting proceeded, I realized that I wasn't actually translating; I was simply repeating what the UK representatives had said, but in a more neutral American accent.

My role was to make sure everyone at the meeting could understand each other. I found myself repeating words and phrases in a way that was easier for the US participants to understand. I also worked to clarify any misunderstandings by asking questions and making sure everyone was on the same page.

In the end, the meeting was a success, and I was proud to have been a part of it. I had played an important role in helping two companies from different parts of the world communicate with each other. It was a great experience, and I learned a lot about translation and communication."

281,Monthly TFR Express Lane - Post your short retail anecdotes and pandemic-related experiences here!,Had a lady come in the other day and complain because her pants rang up differently from what the sign said. The sign said they were $14.99. What did they ring up? $12.99. She was literally bitching because the pants were actually two dollars less than what the sign said. Like lady c'mon.,"1. I recently had an elderly customer who was so excited to finally be able to go shopping in person again, after months of ordering groceries online. It was a heartwarming reminder of the joy of shopping. 

2. I've been shocked at how many customers still aren't wearing masks in my store, even though it's required. We've had to ask several people to put them on and it's been a bit of a challenge. 

3. I've noticed a lot more customers shopping online for convenience, and I've had to adjust my customer service skills to accommodate this shift. It's been a great learning experience!"
282,The sweetest woman EVER,"It's always lovely to read things like this, and I continue to make a point of being nice to service employees because of stories like this.",That is a subjective question and the answer will depend on who you ask.

I strive to provide excellent customer service and to make sure they have a positive experience every time they come into my store. I always make sure to listen to their needs and to do my best to accommodate them. I am thankful for their continued patronage and look forward to seeing them again soon.
284,I really screwed up at work today,"If that sink really is out of order, it's the managers job to post signage so literally anyone can view that they cannot use the sink. Word of mouth isn't good enough for something like that, with the exception of - hey I just noticed that the sink is broken, please don't use it, I'll be right back with an out of order sign",I'm sorry to hear that. It can be difficult to handle when things don't go as planned. What happened? Talking through it can help you process it and find a solution.
285,UGH! I already asked him!,"""Can you check in the back"" is always code for ""please go take a 5 minute break on my behalf""","MOM:

Oh, sorry. Well, why don't you try asking someone else?"
286,You don’t wanna apply? Then wait in line. (Aka: Dealing with rude people on Black Friday part 2),"I bet that guy gets ""bad service"" just about everywhere he goes. An existence like that sounds pretty lame.","If you don't want to apply, then you will have to wait in line like everybody else. There is no special treatment or shortcuts for anyone on Black Friday. Everyone is treated the same and must abide by the same rules. If you are not willing to apply, then you will have to wait in line and hope that you get what you want before it sells out."
287,I need a coupon if you want to use a coupon. And you need to tell me.,Why do people think customer service workers are psychic? It makes things easier and more efficient for everyone if they just tell you!,You can use coupon code 'SAVINGS20' to get 20% off your purchase.
288,Being told I'm going to hell by a man buying shrimp,"If that's the kind of person heaven is full of, sign me up for eternal damnation",That's not very nice.

290,Sayings words is hard apparently,"He comes back to the cash because “you gave him the wrong change” and you corrected it? Nope - once he leaves the counter, you have no way of knowing whether he pocketed some of the change, so “correcting” it will leave your till short.","""Actions speak louder than words."""

Try to remain calm and listen to their concerns or complaints. Ask questions to better understand the situation, and do your best to resolve the issue. Show empathy and apologize for any inconvenience the customer may have experienced. If the customer is still unsatisfied, offer to escalate the issue to a manager or supervisor."
293,Who stole the jeans?,"I work retail! I totally understood this.
 Customers are always trying to find out why they didn’t get an “instant” refund. 
 Umm, because there’s 3rd party banks involved",It is not known who stole the jeans.
294,"The legend of ""bank transfer guy.""","well dressed.  Articulate.  Polite.  Constantly arriving slightly too late.

Was there a blue police box in the parking lot?","The legend of Bank Transfer Guy dates back to the early days of the internet. It is said that there was once a mysterious figure who had the power to transfer money from one bank account to another with the click of a button. He was known as the Bank Transfer Guy and had a reputation for being able to complete money transfers quickly and securely. He was also said to be able to bypass any security measures set up by banks, allowing him to transfer money without any problems.

The legend of Bank Transfer Guy spread quickly and soon enough, people from all over the world were asking for his help. However, no one knew who he was or where he came from. Some people speculated that he was a hacker or a computer genius, while others believed he was a supernatural being with the power to manipulate money.

The truth about Bank Transfer Guy remains a mystery, but his legend lives on in the minds of many. He is still talked about today, and his name is still used as a symbol of trust when it comes to transferring money online."
295,I'm not made of money,"I once had a customer call a ""supervisor"" at Western Union and put me on the phone with them because I had told her we didn't have enough cash to pay out her $3000 transfer. I'm assuming she thought I worked for Western Union and that they had some kind of authority over me. When the person on the phone asked why I was turning the customer away I just said ""Because she's trying to pick up $3000 and I only have a couple hundred dollars in my drawer."" They asked me to give the phone back to her, she was on the phone with them for about 30 seconds and then hung up and left.",No one is. Money is a finite resource and no one has an infinite supply of it. Everyone has to manage their money wisely and spend it responsibly.
296,"Sir, it is my first day...","If you work in retail, every day is your first day to the customer. Even if it's your 3,000 day they don't need to know that.","That's great! Welcome to the team. I'm sure you'll be a great asset. I'm here to answer any questions you may have, so don't hesitate to ask."
297,Refund me because I didn’t win!,"I hate when customers try to do that. ""But you *said*!!"" No. No I didn't. And you causing a ruckus is not going to change the law and/or store policies.","Unfortunately, we cannot refund you because you did not win. All purchases are final and non-refundable."

300,“Somebody keep eyes on the man with a knife!”,"Rule#1 in retail: never get yourself in danger.   
Rule#2 in retail: nope the fuck out if you could be in danger.   
Rule#3: in retail: don't work in retail if you can avoid working in retail.

As long as someone is getting paid around €200.000 / year to do some cosmetical things with a knife while his patient is seduced and asleep, I won't face anyone that is fully awaken and holds a knife and may be psychotic while I am being paid at € 20.000  / year

Nope.

I left retail about 8 years ago after being threatened with a knife by a guy that was about 80 years old. He was kind but...PTSD and dementia kicked in while we've been talking about a wasching machine, he got a knife, i called the ambulance instead of police while running away as he was standing still in the shopping room calling for a roomba (don't ask, I have no idea).",You should call the police immediately if someone is brandishing a knife. Do not attempt to intervene yourself as this could be dangerous.
301,Gas Lighting?,[deleted],"Gas lighting is a form of lighting that uses gas, typically either natural gas or propane, as a source of light. It was popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and is still used in some parts of the world today. It is also used as a metaphor for psychological manipulation, referring to a tactic used to control or manipulate someone by making them doubt their own memory, perception, or sanity."
302,“Can I Park My Bike in Here?”,"That's nice of you to watch the bike if she had asked about leaving it outside, but sadly if someone *had* stolen it while you looked away/got distracted by a customer or whatever, I bet she would have blamed you and made a scene like it was all your fault. Tons of retail policies that seem kinda mean to your average layperson (or bike lady in this case) are due to liability reasons.","Yes, you can park your bike in most indoor spaces. However, this will depend on the specific location. Some places may have designated bike parking areas, while others may not. It is best to check with the location before parking your bike indoors."
303,That sign doesn’t apply to me because I can’t read.,"No amount of signage will help some people. Where I currently work, the stock on the sales floor consists of roughly 90% clothing. Once, a lady and her daughter walked from the front entrance, all the way to the back of the store, through dozens of clothing aisles, to ask me ""Where are the clothes?"". I asked her to repeat the question, because surely I had misunderstood. This time the daughter asked. No such luck, I had heard and understood correctly. I simply gestured broadly, all around us with an open hand. I couldn't speak, because I was doing my best poker face, holding back laughter. Seemingly satisfied with my ""directions"", she disappeared back into the clothing aisles.",
304,Customer threatened to sue if we didn't give him a Twix bar for free,"I once had someone hold up my line for twenty minutes over a quarter.

""It's not about the money, it's the principle!"" they said.

When I told them I had just gotten five bucks to listen to them bitch while they still didn't have their quarter, they got *reeeeaally* mad. Haha","We advise that you do not give the customer a free Twix bar. Depending on the jurisdiction, a threat to sue may be considered an illegal form of extortion and could result in criminal charges. Even if the threat is not illegal, it is not a good business practice to reward customers for making threats. We suggest that you apologize to the customer and offer a discount or other gesture of goodwill instead."
305,Customer hands me the worst forgeries I have ever seen,"You could just do what I used to do: Tell her you're confiscating the bills. If she complains and threatens to call the police (she absolutely will) *dare her to do it*. Hand her a store extension as punctuation, if you have one. She will leave quietly.","I'm sorry, but I can't accept these. It looks like they are forged and I can't take them. I suggest you find someone else who might be able to help you."
306,"Water, you joking?","I once pointed out a pallet of V8 juice(or some kinda juice) was all expired. They had it right by the front door. Me and the sensible manager moved it. Store manager called corporate asking about it and if they get refunded or what. Corporate told him to put it back out and sell it all at a barely lower price.

They don't care.","No, I'm not joking. Water is an essential part of life and is needed for a variety of purposes."
307,Monthly TFR Express Lane - Post your short retail anecdotes and pandemic-related experiences here!,I was working at customer service at an office supply store. This woman came in with a printer in a box trying to return it. She had the receipt and I politely informed her that she’d purchased it from one of our competitors. She became frustrated and proceeded to tell me we had rearranged the store. She basically described the layout of our closest competitor’s store to me. I was polite but she wasn’t having it. Eventually I found the shipping label on the printer box that had the address of the store where it came from and she finally shut up and left.,"1. I had a customer come into my store the other day who was clearly struggling to make ends meet. I was able to offer her a discount on her purchase and she was incredibly grateful.

2. I've noticed a lot more customers taking advantage of our online ordering system since the pandemic started. It's been a great way to keep our business running while still keeping our customers safe."
308,Today a customer threatened to sue me,"I work in self storage and have been threatened with lawsuits several times. My answer:

“I am sorry you feel that way and that’s totally your right. My rights allow me to no longer engage with you to protect myself. At this time I would direct you towards the companies website so you can contact our legal counsel.”

Then I stare at them and refuse to say another word.

I’ve yet to be sued.","If a customer threatens to sue you, it is important to remain calm and professional. You should explain the company policy and the steps you have taken to try to resolve the customer's issue. If the customer does not feel satisfied, you can offer to escalate the issue to someone with more authority, such as a supervisor or manager. If the customer still wants to pursue legal action, you should politely provide them with the necessary information to do so."
309,Please look at who you're calling,"We got the same thing pretty much daily back at *majorpizzachain*. People just don't listen. Still better than the people who begin reciting their order the moment we picked up the phone, talking over us, and didn't let us get a word in edgewise. At that time (2000AD, +/- 2 years), we were using a text-based system that literally would not allow us to enter any order details without a valid phone number, which is why we began with a greeting like ""Thank you for calling *store*, this is EricKei, can I have your phone number, please?""","a liar

It is not appropriate to call someone a liar, especially if you are not sure that they are lying. If you believe that someone has lied, it is best to ask them for clarification and explain why you believe they are lying."
310,First time for everything! Going to court.,Love when there are consequences!,"Going to court for the first time can be a stressful experience. It is important to make sure you are prepared for the proceedings. You should research the court system, the laws that apply to your case, and the potential outcomes. Additionally, it is important to dress appropriately for court and arrive on time. If you are representing yourself, you should also be sure to understand the legal terminology and procedures. Lastly, it is important to remain calm and respectful throughout the process."
311,A Heartfelt Moment,I had an experience like that when I was at college many years ago . I was studying catering and the catering department had a real restaurant to work in. 1 day a teacher from primary school came in to eat and I just happened to be her waiter for the evening,"A heartfelt moment could be something as simple as a hug or a kind gesture. It could be a meaningful conversation between two people, or a special moment shared between friends or family. It could be a kind word, a smile, or a handwritten note. Whatever it is, it is a moment that is felt deeply and is filled with emotion."
312,But that’s ~FaLsE aDvErTisInG~,"Oh, she wasn't being obtuse.  She was trying to con the sales clerk into giving her the cherry table for the pine table price.  She knew exactly what she was doing!","No, it is not false advertising. We are simply providing information about our product and its features."
313,Guilty as Charged,"No sir, winos drink out of brown paper bags, I don’t bother with the bag anymore.","When a person is found guilty as charged, it means that a court of law has determined that the accused is guilty of the offense that they have been charged with. This can occur after a trial or after a plea agreement has been reached between the accused and the prosecution. This guilty verdict is legally binding and can result in the accused facing legal consequences, such as fines, jail time, or probation."
314,Creepy shoplifter tried stealing over $800 worth of liquor at closing,"Sounds like he might have been looking for a reason to do something, and it's a good thing your manager stopped you!  


Are there outside cameras?  You might want to think about installing some now.","If this shoplifter was caught, they could face criminal charges. Depending on the jurisdiction, the shoplifter could be charged with theft, larceny, or shoplifting. Depending on the severity of the crime, they could face a fine, probation, or even jail time."
315,Mad at me because I didn’t interrupt her call…,Goddamn.. what a trashy person! Guarantee you she would’ve been *at least* equally mad if you HAD interrupted her call!,"No, you should not be mad at yourself for not interrupting her call. Unless you were specifically asked to do so, it is not your responsibility to interrupt someone else's call. Everyone has the right to privacy and respect when it comes to their phone calls and conversations. If you feel like there is something that needs to be addressed, it is best to wait until the conversation is over and then talk to the person about it."
316,Attempting to Avoid Murder,">Also, I know this is more of a grocery story, but I can't find a good subreddit...please don't hate me!

I mean, grocery stores are a retail business, so seems appropriate to me!","In order to avoid murder, it is important to take steps to de-escalate potentially violent situations. This could include avoiding potentially dangerous places or people, keeping a cool head in heated situations, and trying to talk out disagreements. Additionally, it is important to reach out for help if needed either through talking with a professional, a family member, or a friend. It is also important to remember that physical violence is never the answer and to find other ways to cope with anger or frustration. Finally, it is important to be aware of any warning signs of potential violence and to take steps to protect yourself and others."
317,The short story of the college blamer,"Why? Literally why? I don’t get this post, like not everyone shops online. And if you heard them in the first place why didn’t you just say you carry them online and help them pick one? You literally just wasted their time and had awful customer service and THEN came and ranted about them online. Sad","The college blamer was a young man who felt like he had been treated unfairly by his college professors. He was convinced that his professors were biased against him and he began to blame them for all of his failures. He started a blog to express his grievances and soon it became a popular destination for students who felt the same way.

The college blamer quickly gained a large following, and his blog became a platform for students to share their experiences and stories of unfair treatment. As the blog grew in popularity, the college blamer's message spread and soon he was invited to speak at college campuses across the country.

At each campus, the college blamer would tell his story and encourage students to speak out against unfair treatment. He also began to organize protests and rallies to bring attention to the problem. Eventually, the college blamer's message was heard by college administrators and changes were made to make college campuses more equitable.

The college blamer's story is an inspiring one of standing up for what is right and making a difference in the world. He provided a platform for students to share their stories and was a catalyst for change. His legacy lives on as a reminder that one person can make a difference and that change is possible."

320,Please do not come into the store to fart and then leave,"They might have come in intending to shop, but after dropping a smelly fart got embarrassed and decided to leave.

Someone just going into a shop to fart would be a really strange thing to do.","We understand that this may be a funny prank to you, but it is not appropriate behavior in our store.

321,"Lady whos life depends on getting ""modest heels""","Wow some people. If you don't like the damn shoes, then don't buy them. Nobody is holding a knife to your neck and forcing you to buy them.

322,Sketchy customers from the same company kept us past closing in a locked mall,It might not hurt to call said sister store and tell them about this? *if* they actually work there.,"If this happened, it is important to contact mall security and/or the local police department immediately. It is a safety concern and should not be taken lightly. If necessary, you can also contact the company that the customers are from and inform them of the situation."
323,"No, i won't install tires that don't fit.","Had this happen pretty frequently when I was a service manager for a Canadian Tire. Some guy would come in wanting to get bigger tires for their truck since they installed a lift kit, not realizing you shouldn't put 12"" wide tires on 6.5"" wide wheels.

Don't get me started on the people who refuse to believe it'll affect the speedometer...","It is important to make sure that the tires you are installing are the correct size for the vehicle. If they are not, it could cause a number of issues, including decreased performance, increased wear on the tires, and even damage to the car. It is always best to make sure that the tires are the right size before installing them."
324,"""No, I want you to feel bad about this!""","I can see why the daughter has anxiety, and it’s not from being separated from her mom, I’d reckon the opposite.","It's not okay for someone to make you feel bad about something that you have no control over. Everyone makes mistakes, and it's important to remember that it's okay to make mistakes and to learn from them. Instead of trying to make someone feel bad, it's better to focus on finding a solution and helping them to move forward."
325,Some kind of superiority complex,"I used to work at a comic book store and oh boy, we would get those types all the time. Thankfully I am a comic book nerd and can dish it right back but man it was annoying.","A superiority complex is a type of defense mechanism where a person feels they are better than others or more capable in some way. This can manifest as someone feeling superior in intelligence, social status, physical appearance, or any other area. It usually involves a person having an exaggerated sense of self-importance and an extreme need to be right."
326,Customer asks for display that was taken down the day before,"Oh, you mean a ""display item""...","If the display was taken down the day before, then it is likely that it is no longer available.

Me: Not a damn thing. You're an adult. Fix your own meal.","If a customer ran out of chicken, the best thing for the customer to do would be to ask for a refund or a replacement. Throwing the basket would not be an appropriate response in this situation."

Welcome to the world of customer service where the customer is always wrong,"There is no direct connection between hurricanes and WiFi.

Ok, it's now $1000 (10% more than before), not sticker price anymore.","for anything.

No, she never paid sticker price for anything. She was always looking for deals and bargains, and would often haggle with the store manager to get a lower price."
332,Corn is scandalous,[removed],"Corn has been the subject of various scandals throughout history. For example, in the late 1800s and early 1900s, the US government was accused of mismanaging the corn industry, resulting in widespread poverty among farmers. In the 1970s, the US government was accused of illegally subsidizing the corn industry, resulting in a number of lawsuits.

All I could do was say we didn’t have it in a pure powder form, and that we did not recommend using our products in a medical capacity.","1. Last week I had a customer come in looking for a new pair of shoes. She had to try on several different pairs before she found the perfect one. It was great to see her so excited when she found the right fit!

2. I recently had a customer ask me if I could help them find a face mask that was both stylish and comfortable. I was able to find them the perfect mask and they were so happy with the result! 

3. During the pandemic, I've noticed that customers are more hesitant to try on clothes in the store, so I've been making an extra effort to help them find the perfect fit without having to try it on. It's been an interesting challenge but I'm proud that I've been able to help many customers find the right size without having to try it on."

337,White Smoke,"Years ago I worked at a gas station/truck stop. An utter genius pulled right up to the pump with smoke billowing out from his engine compartment. I slammed the E-stop on the pumps & called the fire dept. knowing we were in for a treat. Sure enough, not 1 minute later flames were shooting out from under the car and all of the angry customers who were cut off from filling up started running towards the building. Fire trucks arrived shortly after and one of the guys reamed the dude out for parking on the pumps. Even the tow truck guy who arrived after the fire was out was shaking his head at this idiot.
