8,On the way to test my biblically accurate endgame AC on the starting area enemy,"Not nearly enough eyeballs.

0/10","I would first prepare by studying the Bible, researching the enemy, and gathering information about the endgame AC I will be using. I would also make sure to practice using the AC in various scenarios to get a better understanding of its capabilities. Once I have a good understanding of the AC and the enemy, I would then formulate a strategy for how to best approach the enemy in the starting area. This would involve taking into account the terrain, enemy numbers, and any other factors that could affect the outcome of the battle. Finally, I would set up a practice session to test out my strategy and make any necessary adjustments before engaging the enemy in the starting area."

14,"What's a game you'd love to see re-released, but it's mired in licensing woes?","JSRF. But if you haven't yet, check out Bomb Rush Cyberfunk.

27,Updating the setup piece by piece,I love the wood style.

29,The trend of relentless pursuit of information about a game prior to its release,"With the games prices skyrocketing, imo ppl are just trying to prevent themselves from buying a bad game.","is a relatively new phenomenon that is largely fueled by the increasing popularity of video games. The rise of the internet has made it easier than ever before for gamers to access information about upcoming releases, from trailers to pre-release reviews. This has led to a culture of anticipation and speculation surrounding upcoming releases, as gamers eagerly await news and updates.

The trend of pre-release information gathering can be seen in many ways. For instance, the most popular gaming websites now regularly post articles and videos about upcoming releases. Social media has become a powerful tool for fans to share their thoughts and opinions on upcoming games, and to spread the word about new releases. Additionally, many gaming companies now offer pre-order bonuses, such as exclusive content or early access to the game, as an incentive to purchase the game before its release.

The trend of pre-release information gathering has both positive and negative implications. On the one hand, it can help to build hype and excitement for upcoming releases, allowing gamers to experience the anticipation and excitement of a game’s launch. On the other hand, it can also lead to unrealistic expectations and disappointment if the game does not live up to the hype. Additionally, some developers have been known to withhold information about their games until the last minute, which can lead to frustration among fans.

Ultimately, the trend of pre-release information gathering is likely to continue as long as video games remain popular. Whether this trend is a good or bad thing will depend on the individual and how they use the information they gain."

Willingham's decision to do so comes amid a clash with DC Comics over the future of the game's adaptation.

The Wolf Among Us video game, which was developed by Telltale Games and released in 2014, was based on the Fables comic book series. In 2018, Telltale Games shut down and the rights to the game were acquired by LCG Entertainment. LCG has since announced plans to develop a sequel to the game, but Willingham has expressed concerns that the new version would not properly honor the original.

In a statement, Willingham said that he had decided to place the Wolf Among Us universe in the public domain to ensure that his vision for the game would be preserved. He said that he hoped his decision would encourage others to create stories and games set in the Wolf Among Us universe, and that he would not seek any compensation for his work.

Willingham's decision to place the Wolf Among Us universe in the public domain will likely have far-reaching implications for the future of the game and the Fables comic book series.

85,[Discussion] Why is backtracking disliked?,"The best examples of backtracking are pretty much always going to come from Metroidvanias. You go through Area X, you get a new power (say a flamethrower), and you think, ""Ooh, I can burn down that giant tangle of vines I couldn't get through before!"", and now you have Area Y to explore.

The important thing is to make the backtracking worth the players time! Going back to the flamethrower, while backtracking to the vines, say you run into an enemy you thought was tough to deal with using your normal gun. Well, now you have a flamethrower, which is going to be way more effective. This helps you understand the combat applications of the new weapon. Then you get into the exploration applications, burning down blockages, and you find upgrades, then eventually you clear the story roadblock, get to Area Y, and you're in the new content!

Don't make me backtrack when you're only doing it to pad out my playtime.","Backtracking is often disliked because it can be inefficient and time-consuming. It requires a lot of trial and error to find the correct solution, and can be very slow. Additionally, it can be difficult to debug, as the code can become complex with multiple nested loops and recursive calls. Finally, it can be difficult to optimize, as it may require a lot of work to reduce the number of steps and improve the time complexity."

It's a fun 3d platformer with a nice story and easy to get into. Also, get Xbox gamepass as it has a ton of variety of games to choose from for $9.99 a month. That should be a great starting point.","It really depends on your niece's preferences and interests, but some popular series that are great for younger gamers include the Mario, LEGO, and Skylanders games. You can also look into the more kid-friendly games from the Sonic the Hedgehog and Pokemon series. Regardless of which series you choose, make sure to choose games that are age-appropriate for her."

The game would be set in a post-apocalyptic world where players can scavenge for items to help them survive and build shelters. Players could also fight off monsters and raiders to gain access to better resources and equipment. 

Players could also interact with NPCs (non-player characters) to gain information and complete quests. The game could also feature a crafting system where players can craft weapons, armor, tools, and other items. 

Players could also take part in online multiplayer battles against other players or AI enemies. The game could also feature an online leaderboard where players can compete against each other for the highest score. 

Finally, the game could also feature a real-life component where players can go to designated locations and take part in physical challenges. These challenges could include completing obstacle courses, solving puzzles, and competing in mini-games.

Europe is one of the largest markets and its controlled by the EC, you want to do business in europe? you follow the EC's rules.","”

The European Games Developer Federation (EGDF) has called on the European Commission to regulate the game engine market to ensure fair competition and prevent market failure. The call comes in response to Unity’s recent announcement that it will be introducing install fees for its game engine.

The EGDF believes that the introduction of install fees is a sign that the game engine market is heading towards market failure, with the largest players becoming increasingly dominant and the smaller players unable to compete. This could lead to a lack of innovation and poor customer service, as well as increased costs for developers.

The EGDF is calling for the European Commission to investigate the game engine market and introduce regulations to ensure fair competition and prevent market failure. The EGDF believes that this will ensure that developers have access to a range of game engines and that competition is maintained, leading to better customer service and lower costs."

You have decent control over your load-out before you start each mission, like what kind of lasers (rapid-fire vs power vs range), missiles (rapid-fire vs heat seeking vs ion), hull variations, engine variations, etc. 

The story is great and teaches you all the ins and outs. Ship control is great, solid handling, and at any point in the mission you can control how much power goes to weapons/engines/shields, and you can even focus shields forwards or backwards. 

I play in VR and it's amazing sitting in the cockpit and watching tie fighters as they fly past you. Very immersive. Highly recommend it in VR if you have the opportunity.","Star Wars Squadrons is a space combat game developed by Motive Studios and published by Electronic Arts. It is set in the Star Wars universe and was released on October 2, 2020 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

Had they made it like the Original Saint's Row games it would've been such a huge success and modding scene would've went wild with it. 😭,"Both Saint's Row and GTA are excellent open world video games that offer a lot of fun and entertainment. Saint's Row is more of a parody of the Grand Theft Auto series and offers a more lighthearted and humorous approach to the open world genre. The missions are more creative and the game world is more vibrant and diverse. GTA, on the other hand, is a more serious and gritty take on the open world genre. The missions are more serious and the game world is more realistic and detailed. Both are great games and it really comes down to personal preference."

As with all things you need level heads from the entire development team to actually create something amazing. It's not only up to the Game Director to make a game good!","Game directors who are passionate about their projects often create games that are well-crafted and engaging. They also tend to be willing to take risks and innovate, which can often result in more unique and enjoyable experiences. Furthermore, if the game director is given enough freedom and resources, they can make games that are much more ambitious than those made by a team with limited resources. This can result in games that are more unique, expansive, and replayable."

I felt so accomplished and proud of myself for finally making it through the level.
121,"Meanwhile, in an alternate universe; ""Gorgeous view! and then I don't believe it...""",Lmaoooo,"The traveler gazed in awe at the majestic landscape before them. The rolling hills of emerald grass glittered in the sun, while the clouds seemed to dance in the sky. They couldn't believe their luck, finding such a beautiful place in a world so filled with chaos. Taking a deep breath, they smiled, feeling at peace for the first time in what felt like forever."
122,Character customization in some rpgs (specifically cyberpunk 2077 and outer worlds) is pointless.,">  You ~~never~~ see your character ~~at all during the game hardly except~~ in menus or riding a motorcycle in cyberpunk.

Sometimes, for me, just knowing I look a certain way is enough. If I can see myself in my full loadout in a menu, I'm good. 

I do understand your frustration with it. It's nice when you can see your character during dialogs, a la Baldur's Gate 3. But even though you don't really see yourself in Cyberpunk, I'm glad I have the option to customise and create... even if it is a little pointless.","The customization of characters in RPGs such as Cyberpunk 2077 and The Outer Worlds can be seen as a way for players to express their own individual tastes and preferences. It can also provide an immersive experience and allow players to identify with a character in a way that is tailored to their own personal style. Ultimately, the choice of whether or not to customize a character in an RPG is up to the player, and whether or not they feel it adds value to their experience."
123,Video Games Remakes: Is the Industry Running Out of Ideas?,"Not a graphics snob or anything, but I loved the Link’s Awakening remake and never played the original, and I’m personally looking forward to Mario RPG, which again I never played.

Paper Mario The Thousand Year Door is one of my favourite all time Nintendo games, but I replayed that quite recently, so not sure about that one lol

Also, decent video","The video game industry is always changing and growing, but some people worry that the industry is running out of ideas. Remakes have become increasingly popular in recent years, but is this a sign of a lack of creativity?

The answer is no. Remakes are a great way to show appreciation for a classic game, while also giving it a modern twist. They also provide an opportunity for companies to make money from an established property. Remakes also have the potential to introduce a classic game to a new generation of players.

Remakes are not a sign of a lack of creativity in the industry. Instead, they are a way to honor the legacy of a classic game while also creating something new and exciting. The industry is still full of innovative ideas, and remakes are just one way to show appreciation for the classics."

126,True horror,Half and half is a coffee cream product that is usually half whole milk (3.25%-3.5%) and half cream (~18%) it’s usually around 10%,"True horror is the fear of the unknown. It is the fear of what lies beyond our understanding and what we cannot control. It is the fear of something lurking in the shadows, waiting to jump out at any moment. It is the fear of the unknown, of the dark, of the unseen and unheard. True horror is the fear of being completely alone and vulnerable with no one to turn to. It is the fear of being completely powerless."
127,Nintendo fans kept saying graphics don’t matter and Mortal Kombat said bet,"Nah I think most of them mean it in a different way. Kinda like style and aesthetic is more important than pursuing photo-realistic graphics.

Lots of Nintendo folks roasted Nin and Gamefreak for latest Pokemon games looking as PS2 shit and playing at 10 fps. They also always appreciate good looking games even in the tech regard. See things like Super Mario Wonder, ToTK, Peach game or Links Awakening remake, people constantly talk about how crisp and eye-candy those games look.

Graphics clearly matter to them in the way that they also want high resolution, more pixels in Mario's stache, great artsyle, etc, on top of stable and good performance.

I don't think there're Nintendo fans out there who are happy with how things like MK1 look and want more ugly shit looking and running like early alpha prototype N64 games. Lots of them just don't mind or love the cartoony look to those games and don't need Nintendo to crate smth like TLoU 2 with photo-realisitc faces and blood-splatters. But I'm sure they want Nin to eventually get into territory of games like Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart aka gimme 4k\\60fps Mario with Ray Tracing looking better than any animated movie ever would.","?

The same goes for the Unreal engine, which I'm pretty sure was iterated upon time and time again all the way back to its original version. 

But, if every line of code is at some point rewritten into another, is it still ""the old engine""? I've never considered that to be the case.","The Unreal Engine, first released in 1998, is the oldest game engine still in use."

I uninstalled it after 2 hours even after getting it free on gamepass,", an adventure game developed by Silverstring Media, is an incredible game that offers a unique and engaging experience. It follows the story of a group of friends who embark on a journey to uncover the secrets of a mysterious island. Along the way, they must face challenges, make tough decisions, and explore a variety of environments. The game also features clever puzzles, a beautiful soundtrack, and an immersive story that keeps players hooked until the very end. High on Life is a great example of how games can be more than just mindless entertainment; it can be an engaging and meaningful experience."

133,Studio Behind EA's Magical FPS Game Lays Off Half Its Staff After Low Sales,Should have fired the marketing team. Never heard of it.,"The studio behind EA’s magical first-person shooter game, Anthem, has laid off almost half of its staff, following disappointing sales. The game was released in February and was met with mixed reviews. The studio, BioWare, is now focusing on Dragon Age 4 and the upcoming Mass Effect game.

The layoffs affected roughly 80 people, according to a report from Kotaku. The studio is now composed of about 200 employees, down from its peak of almost 400.

The studio’s general manager, Casey Hudson, wrote in a blog post that the layoffs were “necessary” in order to “better deliver on our future projects.” He also said that the studio had to “make some difficult decisions” in order to ensure that the studio was “structured in the right way” for future projects.

The layoffs come at a difficult time for the studio, which has been struggling to make a successful game since the release of Mass Effect 3 in 2012. While the studio has seen some success with the Dragon Age and Mass Effect series, its most recent game, Anthem, has been a disappointment. The game was met with mixed reviews and has failed to make a lasting impression on the gaming community.

BioWare is now focusing on two upcoming projects: Dragon Age 4 and the next installment of the Mass Effect series. It’s unclear if the studio will be able to turn around its fortunes with these games, but the layoffs are a sign that the studio is taking steps to ensure its future projects are successful."

Yahman the Shaman.

The first NPC I clicked on (also a troll) blurted out: YAHMAN!

(For those who haven't played WoW, the trolls have a kind of Jamaican accent, so he was saying ""Yeah Man!"" but it sounded more like ""Yahman"".","The best name I ever gave a character was “Aurora”. I thought it was fitting for the character because it was both feminine and strong, and it had a bit of a mythical quality to it that seemed to fit the story. Aurora was a courageous and determined protagonist, and the name seemed to capture that perfectly."
143,Do punishes and option selects exist in games outside of fighting games?,"Kinda, punishes are an easy concept to convert. In any game with guns, shotguns typically have a much longer reload and delay between shots, get them to whiff their shot and while they're reloading bully them, if you've ever played sea of thieves this is functionally the only way to board from the ladder without getting extremely lucky.

Option selects or OS are little tougher, (for the uninformed it's a concept in fighting games where you structure your input so you have an initial desired outcome but incase something else happens you get an input that functionally covers that, like teaching grabs with lights so if they don't grab you just smack them and if they grab you just tech out immediately). Depending on how you think about pause buffering as an option select then it's used all the times in speed runs, other than that I guess pinning a piece in chess is technically a super slow paced OS. I'm going to need help from people more familiar with other genres as that concept doesn't apply as cleanly as the reason why they work in fighting games, don't really exist frequently in other genres.","Yes, punishes and option selects can exist in games outside of fighting games. For example, in a real-time strategy game, a player may “punish” an opposing player for making a certain move by quickly counteracting it with their own strategic move. Option selects can also exist in games outside of fighting games, such as a platformer game where the player must select the optimal jump to reach a certain platform."

What is amazing is that Unity heard the concern their own staff had and released the statement without answering their own questions on how this would all work.

Now, it feels like that safety has been taken away.” The employee also called on the company to take a stand against hate and violence, and to take steps to ensure the safety of its employees."

The game's code is open-source, meaning that cheats are easily detectable, and the game's developers have taken a hard stance against cheating, banning players who are caught using cheats.

I'm happy you found a game that brings you much joy to this day,", like Monopoly, and I realized how much fun it was to play those games with my family. It was a great way to spend time together and enjoy each other's company. I think it's important to find time to do activities together as a family, and playing board games is one of the best ways to do that. Not only does it bring everyone together, but it also encourages communication, problem solving, and strategic thinking. It's a great way to bond with each other and have some fun."

The devs might have hidden some goodies there.,"One game that has influenced the way I have played games ever since is The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. This game has made me more aware of how important exploration is in video games, and how much more enjoyable a game can be when you take the time to explore the world. It also taught me the importance of experimentation and taking risks, as even the most seemingly insignificant actions can have a major impact on the game. From this game, I learned to approach new games with an open mind, and to take the time to explore and experiment with the different mechanics and features of games."

However, if you are determined to try to use the lettuce/salad spinner as a controller, you could try to rig up something that could detect the motion of the spinner and translate it into the necessary inputs for the game. This might involve some tinkering and coding, but it could be possible to create a makeshift controller."

The city is full of buildings of all shapes and sizes, from small houses to towering skyscrapers. There are also plenty of parks and green spaces, as well as public squares and monuments. The streets are lined with shops, restaurants, and other businesses. A major highway runs through the city, connecting it to the other cities in the region.

The region is also home to many different kinds of creatures, from friendly villagers to hostile mobs. There are also a wide variety of plants, from tall trees to small shrubs. The land is filled with resources, from coal and iron to rarer gems and minerals.

The 10,000 day map of my Minecraft City Region is a stunning display of creativity and imagination. It is a testament to what can be accomplished in a virtual world, and a reminder of the wonderful possibilities that exist in Minecraft."
